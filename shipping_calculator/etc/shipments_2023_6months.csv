event space - main area is the Town Hall. There are air walls that open up to a smaller event space across the hall. We are planning for 14 lines in the main room and 6 across the hall. They are literally just separated by a wide hallway. It will feel like 1 large space - just spread out a little. There is an elevated stage in the main space as well.

electrical - not a lot of wall outlets, and they said they are connected and often blow the circuits. They know what we need, and said they would talk to their facilities team and get it figured out. You might test this during set up the day before.

sound - they have it; 2 event spaces share the same sound system and speakers are in both areas.

trash - asked for several trash cans to be available when we arrive

parking & security - park in the visitor lot or North parking lot. This will be free. Proceed to main entrance. Follow the signs. It takes a little bit of time to park and walk into the building. Allow some extra time. All staff will need their ID for security. They'll give you a security badge.

This event will count towards their community service membership goals. There will be ~ 200 adults, primarily mothers, also attending the conference as their conference proceeds the teen conference.  However, other than a few KVs, they will not be participating in the HP.

The host will be providing 10 KVs.  4 dad's/mom's will be present for set-up starting at 12:30pm.  6 teens will be selected as table captains for both shifts and will arrive at 1:30pm for table training.  Host also said that there will be many mom's & dad's available for load-out since the timeline is tight from end of project to pick-up. 

USH does have to be present for load-in on Thursday.  Unfortunately, there is no direct path from the loading dock to the restaurant that is pallet friendly so we will need to take the pallets through the prefunction space, down to the lobby, and then back over to the restaurant. There are a few rugs in the back hallways. There is a carpet in the meeting space that they do not allow motorized pallet jacks on.  It is approximately 350’ from the loading dock to the restaurant. The rice will need to be stored somewhere else the night before so this will add to the distance it travels.

The HP on Friday will be held in a restaurant at the hotel.  
The room has enough space and tables for 6 ALs, however, the table sizes and lengths vary (see below).  I suggest that the EL view the area on Thursday evening or Friday AM to best advise on set-up.

If all volunteers participate, there will be 16 volunteers/table.  The host is open to having some volunteers help with restocking and moving boxes to reduce congestion at tables.  

Electric - we will handle.  Plenty outlets available

This is the last day of the intern's weeklong orientation. They are doing this because past participants have given feedback saying they wanted a ""give back"" event as part of orientation. 

The hosts are wonderful to work with, but have not participated in a project before. They also work at other JPMC locations, so they don't know much about the facility. So, there are the hosts, the facilities manager and the ""district"" facilities manager who all have opinions about how this should go. Luckily, we have been done projects at this site before and the people on site have been very helpful to us in the past. 

The district facilities manager has made it VERY CLEAR that we are to get pallets on and off the truck. Once they are off, the JPMC porters will take care of getting them to the event room. We have to use a freight elevator, which has a 1,000 lb limit so they have said that we will have to make them all half pallets before moving them to the space. The room itself is not pallet friendly so you will have to unload pallets to get the supplies in the room. 

The load in window is small because their dock is ""so busy."" We also can't take the supplies to the room until after 5:30pm due to the conference room being occupied until 5:00pm that day.

They will lay electric for us.

They say we don't need tablecloths but past PEARs said they are wood tables, so I am sending them just in case.

*The host has not said anything about low volunteer count and with the 4 shifts, you should have plenty of time to do a track talk and hit meal goal. However, when talking with the entire planning team I keep getting the feeling that the volunteers will be late to each shift as the conference/training is more important to them. So, I requested 12 meal bags be sent. The warehouse team is able to send 2 boxes of 12 meal bags. Each box gets you 16,800 meals. This is the back up plan just in case! Please try to use all 6 meal bags and only switch to 12 meal if you are far behind!

We have not hit meal goal at a good handful of JPMC Goodworks Grant projects lately, so I really want to hit it at this one! If you go over a bit, even better! :)

The head of the Goodworks Grant will be there for this event.","06/15/23

They are not doing it as part of their family day this year, but the volunteers will still be employees and their families. People are coming in on their day off, as well as some coming before their shift. 

The PEAR said that last year they were packing kind of slow and the host confirmed that. We quoted this as all 12 meal bags based off that the fact that the CEO wanted to increase the meal goal by 5K from last year. If they pack at a normal rate, you will for sure not need the 2 hours, but the host wanted to leave it that way just in case. I foresee you not getting started right on time and with it being families it will be good to have extra time!

The space is kind of like a bay garage with big doors that can come down. Host confirmed that there are swamp coolers in there, so hopefully it won't be hot.

They are handling load in/out for us and will bring the pallets to the space for us. I have reminded her several times that the food pallets have to be stored in A/C before they bring them to the packing area on event day.

-They will attach a different color ""label"" for each shift. (They will provide labels.) This is because they want to send those meals to different MD recipients in each region.

Parents often bring children.  They love to have fun and take their time.  That is why extra time has been allotted for the meal packing.  You will probably end early. 

Different from previous years, the HP will be preceded by a  worship rally from 8:30am-9am.  This is where the congregation will come together outside the venue to reflect on the day of service they are about to embark on.  Following the rally, the parishioners will disperse to one of several charitable activities planned for the day.  One of which is our HP starting at 9:15am.  Five KVs will be excused from the rally at about 8:50am for table captain training.

Upon arrival, you will go in the main entrance.  You can pull the van in the roundabout out front to load in and then move the van to the parking lot.  The ballroom is located just inside the main entrance to the right.
Meals will be brought back to USH for pick-up the next day, Monday, by Servant's Heart Ministry.

They have done this project several years in a row and they are a fun group, especially the host!

This is a two day project. The schedule and meals packed per day will look the same both days. 

Per day
20,000 meals
4 lines
2 shifts
50 volunteers per shift

They have had issues with getting volunteers to actually show up in the past, so I highly encouraged her to over recruit! I told her if she recruits 60 people and all of them show, we will still be good with 15 people per line. 

IF by chance you have all full lines and can over pack, please do it! We have had a few other JPMC Goodworks Grant projects not hit their meal goal by quite a lot, so if we can make up some of those meals here, that would be awesome! No pressure though!

It is kind of an interesting location. You have to load in on an indoor track to get to the cafe where the project will take place. The space seems to be easy to navigate, but just a lot walk across the track. 

They have also had questionable tables in the past because they use the cafe tables. Please make sure that the table with the food bins on them are sturdy!

This HP is one event schedule at the church for this day as part of how they volunteer on National Serve Day.  They do expect ~ 80 volunteers, however, with other competing events, they could have less.  This should not be a problem because we have added a break in the middle of their shift.  Danti wants all volunteers contributing for ""as close to 2 hours"" as possible.   If needed, we could either go longer than 11:15am or eliminate the break.  We can expect all ages from 10-65.

They are very nice, but previous pears say they are very slow packers and don't always get the full volunteers for the full time. The host said that last year the feedback was that 1.5 hours was too long so he is adamant that it is only an hour this year. I told him we HAD to have 3 full lines of volunteers in order to make that happen. I suggested he publicize for 45 people to ensure we have enough in case people don't show up. The room is not big enough to add any more lines.

I would highly suggest starting with 2 sealers on each line in order (extras have been requested) to help with possible sealing bottleneck and to make sure they get done in an hour! This will also help if one stops working on a line for a bit, they will still have one that can keep going.

You will be able to take the pallets up the freight elevator to the 28th floor, but you will have to load it onto carts to take into the room as it is not pallet friendly. I am having them send an extra cart for you. You will have to store the pallets near the loading dock.

As for security, it seems like this location is more relaxed. However you will need someone to escort you around as badges are needed to let you into different spaces. Please also make sure to have your ID!

The direct path from the room to the loading dock (approx 800 ft) is not suitable for pallets.

They also want extra sealers around the room, but I told them 2 sealers per line will be great! (They packed with another meal packing organization in the past who structures their assembly lines differently than us and they think their sealing model works better.)

They will also be placing a chair at the end of each line for the boxes to not be on the floor, so their employees do not have to bend over to fill the boxes.

This is not the first time we have been to this building, but it is this department's first time packing with us. The reason there are so many shifts is they thought this was a more ""come and go"" packing boxes of already packaged food and could have it out over a weeks time. This was the compromise we came up with. I know it's not ideal, but the hosts are really excited about it and they are trying to make it fun!

The host is handling load in for us. Their facilities team will take all of the pallets to the event space for you! They will also have to make MD and our supply pallets down to the loading dock at the conclusion of the project.

Security is a big deal at this location!
When you pull in, show ID to the guard. Come straight into the main entrance and park in visitor parking. North end. Follow the walkway to main entrance and you will meeting host, Lisa, to check in at security and get a temporary badge. You will have to be escorted everywhere.

Packing is on Floor 3B in the common area at the front of their office space. They want the event to be fun, but please be mindful of the music level as others will be working.

They are having a employee appreciation cookout alongside our project. They will both be happening around the same time in the same location, but she said the people packing will stay on the lines the whole time and others will be filtering in and out for food. Just don't expect the food people to jump on and pack. 

The KVs won't be table captains, they are just there to help set up and with any logistics needs.

This will be outside under some tents. Their facility is 24hr, so they will be working in the warehouse and will not be shutting down for the event. They also can not guarantee PVC particles would not be in the air. Their team will move the pallets outside to the tents for you. They have a generator to plug in the sealers and the sound system. They are renting the sides for the tents as well in case of weather.

Since you will be outside, I am sending tablecloths just in case you need them for the tables or to cover things. :)

You should not need the full 2 hours for the event, but we built in some buffer time.

They are handling load in/out for us. I have instructed them that all food needs to be placed in A/C before and after the event. 

-----------------------------------

Parking - The front of their building is for Amazon. You have to drive through the back fence to get to the gravel parking lot. They are Dock 8.

No Wifi - Please download your playlists!

Trash - They will bring cans out for you

-----------------------------------

It is scheduled as one shift just like last year, but here are some notes from last year's PEAR: Volunteers :The volunteers came in shifts from work even though the project only had 1 shift. The first group of volunteers packed about half of our meal count and then they were dismissed to take a group picture and eat. While they ate we also had the next shift come. Support staff and I trained but the best part was the volunteers from the first group had so much fun that they came back to help pack more by choice. It was so fun and the volunteers had a great time talking , packing, singing and dancing. We had 4 people help set up that also packed on the lines during the event.

I talked to the new host about this and she said it would be one shift, but I wanted you to see what happened last year just in case it ends up happening again.

Goal is 750-1K volunteers - mostly youth ages 12-26. The volunteers are actually signing up for 3 hours shifts. Meal packing is 2 hours and the other hour is lunch and a concert. Could be some of the same volunteers or a new group. Could be 1K-2K total volunteers.

KVs:
The host is recruiting 25 Set Up KVs and 100 KVs per shift: 70 for Table Captains, 30 for Logistics

There will be a site plan for the tables. There will be 7 groups of 10 lines with colored tablecloths: Black, Red, Blue, Green, Orange, Purple, Yellow. The volunteers will get a colored name tag with their table number and colored section. 

The venue has a forklift that the host is renting for load in/out. Our certified people can drive. 

They'll handle getting the MD partners. The first round of MD orgs will come at the end of Shift 1. There will be a lot of them and some are only taking a few boxes. We will get a list from the host so we will know how many pallets to wrap and how many to leave open for the smaller orgs to grab from.

They have a DJ/emcee lined up but we will have access to the mic for box races, meal updates, etc.

They will have McDonalds for breakfast on event day and probably Pizza Hut for lunch. We are welcome to join if there is enough!

We will have to assist in setting up tables, so I am having the KVs come at 8:00am so we can get the tables set while we wait for the trucks. The host is not sure how long they will stay, but at least they will be there to help get us started.

Electric - There are many outlets around the room, but it will be a lot of gaffing. The venue will have their electricians on site on set up day to drop boxes closer to the lines.

This is the first HP for AVI-SPL Dallas.  However, they will be joining AVI-SPL Tampa who has participated in HPs for many years.  AVI-SPL Tampa will also be packing 20K 6 meal packs during the same time.  This will be broadcast at both sites as they try to sync the events together.  However, for planning purposes, these are being handled as 2 seperate HPs with 2 different AFs.  The hosts will let the day of event leads know if they want them to coordinate anything regarding joint box races etc. during the HPs.  NOTE: Time change if looking at Tampa event.  Times will appear 1 hour later (EST).
AVI-SPL Tampa always has 2 ALs, 3 1 hour shifts and always finish packing 20K 6 meal packs on-time.  They move fast and are competitive.  The host of Tampa insists that our staff can assist the tables in packing, however, past PEARS have indicated that some volunteers have gotten upset when other teams won prizes after receiving assistance.  Your call!!! 
Since this is Dallas's first HP, they might not be as fast as Tampa.  If that is the case, the hosts are fine extending the packing time of each shift 5-10 minutes, except the last shift, since there is 30 minutes between shifts.  They rather do this than incorporate 12 meal bags.

Recently, Dallas requested that USH completes are portion of the load-out by 1pm because they will be closing the building for an off-site event starting at 1pm.  One hour after the event concludes.  I informed them that I can't make any guarantees but that we will try.  They will leave one person behind to lock the facility if needed.  As such, they are fine with US Hunger palletizing the equipment and meals inside the event room.  They will transport the pallets to the doc for pick-up.  They will also provide KVs to assist in clean-up if needed.  However, with 2 ALs and plenty of time between shifts to load the meals, it may not be needed.  Again, your call!

They will be loading in for us and leaving everything on the dock overnight. The event space is on the same level as the dock and they said it isn't too far of a walk, but it is carpet the whole way there. They also confirmed that the floor is pallet friendly and will have a pallet jack for you to use if needed. Last year, we had to cart all of the lentils and rice down since there was a 600lb weight limit for the floors. We were able to use the pallet jack for the pallets with other supplies.

They had several carts we were able to use. The room only has a single door, so we will have to unload all pallets into the event space and then store the pallets on the dock. 

There were several extra volunteers each shift last year so we had some of them help us take completed meal boxes to the dock to be palletized.

You will have KVs to help with set up and tear down. Last year several people just offered to stay and help clean up. If they are able, get them to help with moving supplies to the dock area.

They are making a fun day of it and having it at a park. They are renting a tent.  

This project is more complex than most with load in and out. Unlike the other Barrette locations, they are a normal office and do not have space for a project. They will be hosting offsite at a park where we can't leave the pallets. You will be going to rent a sprinter van to pick up the pallets at terminal nearby, and dropping them back off after the project. 

They are a fun group from last year's PEAR.

The host did request to increase their meal goal, but with the sprinter van limitations we can only go as high at 15K. If they are rockin and rollin and you can pack a few extra boxes (within our normal overage limits) I'm sure that would go along way to make the host happy. BUT there is no expectation or pressure from me for that! :)

--------
Notes from last year's PEAR I found helpful:

The tables were set up outside in the grass underneath a large tent. The morning dew made the tables rather wet, we had to dry them off with some paper towels from a nearby bathroom. The ground was a bit uneven, not anything to be concerned about, it was a very slight hill that it was on. Due to the tables being wet at first, supplies slide a bit on the table. As the sun came up more, the area dried and it was no longer an issue.

There was a building 15 yards away where we ran power to. The concrete was very challenging for the gaffers tape to properly stick to. For outdoor projects we should send the gorilla's gaffer's tape, it does a great job of sticking to the concrete.

The grass was still wet from the morning so we put the boxes at the end of the line needing to be packed on top of broken down boxes from set up in order to keep them dry. 

We were able to pull the van up right to the tables so this was a smooth set up. 

The carts were more so used to hold the completed boxes at the end of the line to avoid them being on the damp grass. There were extra volunteers who wanted to float around so they carried the boxes over to the pallet for us. They made it incredibly easy for our team.

-----------

The project is a hour later this year so maybe the dew won't be as much of an issue, but I am still requesting our team send paper towels just in case. I am also requesting they send the gorilla's gaffers tape for electrical and and extra cart. I have also requested tablecloths just in case you need them since it is outside and the tables are rented.","08/24/22

They normally host this event outside in the winter, USH insisted on holding indoors due to summer heat.  In 2022, they held the event without USH staff so they are experts.

This is part of missions day so there will be other activities occurring on site.

Host will handle load-in and load-out.  Upon arrive, we should enter the worship hall through the front doors.  The West Fellowship Hall is down on the left.  Call Marc when you arrive if he is not already there to greet you.

Table Captains will arrive at 5:30pm for training.  Host would like to open up the event space for volunteers at 6pm.  He will then lead them in prayer, give a presentation and then introduce US Hunger staff.  He wishes to MC the event.  There will be no need for a USH intro other then the one he provides.  

The host expects that the packing will begin around 6:30pm.  There might also be more than 225 volunteers.  He mentioned the possibility of 300.  I mentioned that the kids could color and others could assist with refilling and carrying boxes if needed.  I told him that the Day of USH lead could assist with this.  I suspect that the event will conclude before 7:30pm.

Pick-up for both meals and equipment will not be until Wednesday, 9/6.  Host is aware that USH will palletize all equipment and meals and leave them in the worship hall for pick-up on Wednesday.  
Since there will be 3 destinations for the meals, 3 pallets should be used.  There should be ~35 boxes on each pallet.  All will be picked up by Convoy of Hope but they will go to 1) Guatemala 2) Haiti 3) Burkina Faso.  Perhaps sticking in a label or two inside the wrap would be nice.

In addition to 16 Table Captains, the host will provide 2-3 KVs to assist with AL break down.

There is construction at their complex so the host has provided a map with detailed instructions on what US Hunger should do upon arrival.  I will forward those directions directly to the EL/LL prior to the event.  Parking is free but it is first come first serve so we may need to walk a bit.

The host is very excited to have an introduction by the event lead.  They are interested in our slide presentation and would love it if we mentioned all the events we have planned around 911 and the Atlanta Hawks.  They would also like us to give a quick mention about Philabundance which will be charity where the meals will be distributed.

Prior to event day, the host will assign 4 teams and those teams will pick their table captains (KVs).  The KVs will arrive at 10am for table captain training.  The host has also requested 4 different color hair nets for each team.  We have secured 4 different colors, red, green, orange and yellow which will be packed in the pink bin.  US Hunger will wear white.

Expect a competition from the 4 teams.  They would probably enjoy some box races.  Given this, I suspect that they will finish packing all their meals on time, however, if that is not the case, they are more than happy to stay until they reach their meal goal.

This is a 100% 12 meal pack event!!!!!

----------------------------
Flooring cafeteria - no pallet restrictions, however, pallets might not be able to fit through the cafeteria doors.  Host does have a pallet jack to transport pallets from dock to cafeteria entrance.  Host also has extra carts if needed.

Host will handle load-in and load-out.  Kari Smitherman, 215-280-6377, is your primary contact for load-in and load-out.

Set-up: They have requested set-up on Wednesday, 9/6 from 3pm-5pm.  Primarily because they are not sure where to store the pallets if they can't fit through the cafeteria doors.  

Electricity - Plenty available.  

Trash - Host is aware to have extra trash bins for set-up on 9/6 and HP on 9/7.

Cafeteria has a sound system accessible via blue tooth or cable hookup for computer.  They have wifi.  Bring playlists.

Bring slide show for 5 minute introduction on US Hunger impact.  This can be tested Wednesday evening.

The Eagles are VERY hands on for this event. They fundraise and recruit volunteers for the first 2 shifts, and they recruit all of the KVs.

parking - L lot off of Darien St. Free parking.

flooring - carpet; be careful!

electrical - 100% will be handled by Eagles staff

sound - house sound with multiple microphones available. DJ/Emcee confirmed

tables - provided by Eagles; should be set up when we arrive (they are providing black linens)

trash - they'll have lots set up around the event space. 
Aramark will clean during and between shifts (floors and trash).","Set up on Sunday as soon as truck arrives. They may have a set up KV crew as well from 1 - 3 pm.

There are branded meal bags and stickers. Best by date printed on 6 meal bags. (If you have to switch to 12 meal bags, you'll need to use the best by stickers printed by USH.)

We have 2 sets of table numbers. 1 set has the number and break down instructions on the bag - attach those to the tables as usual. 2nd set has the number on one side and clean up instructions between shifts on the other. That will be the one held up by the TCs.

-----------

USH arrive onsite at 7 am on event day!

Key Volunteers were recruited by the Eagles staff - 2 shifts:

7:30 am - 2:30 pm 
1:30 pm - 6:30 pm

Expect at least 40 Table Captains and 25 Logistics support. I asked for 1 table captain per line, but they were insistent that their table captains were bored last year, so they wanted to be sure there is enough work for them.

Expect vols to begin arriving 30 min prior to each shift. They'll be assigned an assembly line at check in - run by the Eagles staff.

There's an opening ceremony at the beginning of each shift which will include VIPs and someone singing America the Beautiful. They may or may not want USH to be involved. Be flexible.

Expect about 90 min of meal packing per shift. 12 meal bags are for back up only!! (25% of meal goal was sent in 12 meal bags.)

---------

Shift 1 - Eagles recruited sponsors/volunteers. Expect 500 vols.

Shift 2 - Eagles recruited sponsors/volunteers. Expect 500 vols.

Shift 3 - 9/11 Day recruited sponsors/volunteers. Expect up to 650 vols.

If all lines are full, you'll only need 90 minutes of meal packing per shift. 9/11 Day asked for the volunteers to be placed on lines in groups of 12. However, if not enough people show up, I'd say go down to 10 per line to try to fill up lines.

----------

Philabundance is the MD partner. They may have a speaker at each shift as well. Pick up of meals will be 2 pick ups: 2 pm and 5:30 pm.

Expect media.

Expect lots of VIPs as well.

","1 shift of KVs - there should be 45 TCs and 24 Logistics. They'll work from 7:30 am - 3 pm. 

There will be 1 TEAM LEAD for the Table Captains and 1 for the Logistics (Heavy Lifters and Runners). Feel free to empower them to do all the communicating with the KVs.

Additional KVs for directional help, registration, and hospitality.

---------

Expect vols to begin arriving 30 min prior to each shift.

Plan for 10 vols per line - that's how 9/11 Day ""sold"" the volunteer spots. Of course, who knows will show up. They are historically low on volunteers, so you definitely could have empty tables.

There's an opening ceremony at the beginning of each shift which will include VIPs and someone singing America the Beautiful. They may or may not want USH to be involved. Be flexible.

Expect about 90 min of meal packing per shift. 12 meal bags are for back up only!! (25% of meal goal was sent in 12 meal bags.)

-------

USH arrive onsite at 7 am on event day!

---------

Table Captains and Logistics KVs will arrive at 7:30 am on event day. 

Planning for 450 vols per shift.

You will not need more than 90 min of packing per shift if all the lines are full. May need the full time if it's light on volunteers.

There are branded meal bags and stickers. Best by date printed on 6 meal bags. (If you have to switch to 12 meal bags, you'll need to use the best by stickers printed by USH.)

We have 2 sets of table numbers. 1 set has the number and break down instructions on the bag - attach those to the tables as usual. 2nd set has the number on one side and clean up instructions between shifts on the other. That will be the one held up by the TCs.

small cut out table numbers should be given to registration so people can find their table number.

Expect media.

Expect lots of VIPs as well.

The project is being held at a fire station downtown. 

They have invited media and the Mayor to join at 9:30am.

The shift is from 9-11, but they know it won't take the entire time to pack meals. They are planning on the first 30 minutes to be for people to arrive, the 9/11 day talks and some guest speakers. You should start training/packing around 9:30am. They know it probably won't take you until 11am, but they wanted to have buffer time and for the shift to be from 9-11am.

There MAY be some firefighters there to help with load in/out but they will for sure have 4 to serve as table captains. 

You will be packing in the fire engine bay area. They will be pulling the trucks out and there should be plenty of space. When you are looking at the front of the building, we will be setting up on the right side closest to the firefighter's dorm side. Their plan is to leave one engine in the furthest bay area for pictures. You will set up right next to that.

Electric - There are outlets/cords hanging from the ceiling.  I would suggest starting a line right were one of those hang down.

Last year they kind of did a ""come and go"" shift and they never had full lines and had to pack for an extra 20 mins. I talked the host into doing 2 shifts this year so the volunteers didn't feel like they had to stay the whole time and could go out and enjoy the other festivities. You should not need the full 1 each shift as long as all of the lines are full. If you are over packed for shift 1 and feel you need to stop it early, the host is ok with them packing for 45 mins!

They are handling load in/out and MD for us! Amazing!!!

You will do set up the day prior since you will come straight from the other site on project day.

For set up, there is a meeting in the room right before set up so you may have to wait a few minutes to start.

You should have plenty of time to clean up New Hyde Park, grab lunch and drive to this site. Please make sure to allow extra time for NY traffic!

For clean up, you will have to use the carts to get our supplies to the lobby for palletizing. Ask the host the specific place they would like you to store the pallet overnight. 

Also, ask the host where they want you to store the meal boxes. They haven't decided yet. They are handling MD!

The host said the entire path is pallet friendly, but the PEAR says pallets can get most of the way and we have to de-palletize so be ready to have to hand load carts for clean up to get to the area you can palletize. The loading dock isn't too far from the event space.

Since they are handling MD, ask them if they want you to wrap the pallet before you waste time doing it. 

You will be heading straight to the next site after clean up. It's about a 50 min drive, but you should still have time to grab lunch and get to the site on time.

It is an employee appreciation day for people to come hang out. They had a lot of activities after the project last year, bounce house, cash grab, prizes, huge lunch, etc. A lot more people showed up than they expected, but many of them were children.

They want it to be outdoors. They will be providing a tent and I gave her the square footage to ensure all the tables are under it. Flint is not warm this time of year, so that isn't a concern. However it might be a bit cold, so plan for that. If it rains, they will move it into the warehouse. This is what ended up happening last year.

They are handling load in and said they will take charge of moving the pallets outside for you on event day. They are also handling MD!

They did have people talk about how low the tables are when standing, so they are considering putting the second table of the line on risers or having chairs available. I highly encouraged chairs! They also said they may only do that for one or two lines just for the people who need it.

They are a VERY competitive group and loved the box races!

Something we found out last year is that the assembly line tables are the same tables they will need to eat lunch on and lunch is planned for right after the pack. So we basically got everything off the tables as soon as possible and then finished cleaning up. It wasn't ideal, but worked out fine. They had a few people who offered to help.

This group packed with us last year and they are VERY excited to be able to do it again!

They are doing this as part of their Family Fun Day again this year! Shonna made it very clear that our team is invited to join in the lunch and activities!

You will need to clear some tables quickly so they can eat lunch on them. Won't need all of them, but try to clear a handful as soon as you can.

The site is HUGE! She said it is 1 square mile and has 3 entrances. Use the truck entrance. She also said the address should bring you to the correct building and they will have signs to direct you. She also said to just call her when you get there and she can help you.

Will be in a warehouse space. She said there is a lot going on in there, but they are clearing space for the project. 

They are providing at least 10 KVs, but she thinks she will have more!

You probably won't need the full 2 hours to pack but they wanted the buffer time. You can end early if you done packing. 

Please make sure they are clear on which pallets will go to the food banks vs which pallets are coming back to us. Please make sure to label with shipping labels and provide the BOL!

Please make sure that they store all pallets with food in an air-conditioned room. I have talked with the client about this!

The church has participated in many HPs in the past.  The HP is scheduled immediately after mass that typically ends around 11am.  It is tricky because some years the volunteers rush into the room and get started, other years, like last year, they take their time.  In addition, they also take a break during the meal packing for a snack and to taste the RLJ (see below).  Given this, I scheduled the HP to begin at 11:15am and end at 12:45pm to provide a 30 minute cushion.  They are in no hurry! 

Host has requested that USH speak to their children about USH and the impact that this day will have our their community during the children's liturgy.  Approximately 15 minutes into the main service, ~10:15am, , the children are sent to a seperate room for a children's liturgy.  It is during this time where they would like USH to speak to them.

The host has requested 3-4 bags of RLJ to prepare samples for the volunteers.  Please pack these bags during the table captain training @ 11am so that they have plenty of time to prepare.  

Flooring: Hardwood - No pallets can be placed on the floor! They are very protective of their floor. Gaff tape is the only tape that can be used on the floor.

Since all equipment and food need to be unloaded from the van and carried up 4 stairs and through a small door before placing on carts, I have added an extra 30 minutes to set-up.

She is very nice, but timid.

Last year we were told that the building is not pallet friendly, but when our team arrived, they found out it is. I have been told 2 different things from multiple people about load in. Some say that our team will have to move everything and the porters will help only in the conference center and others say the porters have to move everything the entire time. The PEAR from last year says that the porters laid ram board and moved everything to the event space. Please be prepared to do whatever they say. The path to the room is supposed to be pallet friendly even if you have to move it. That is based off of conversations and previous PEARS.

Sound - They have a sound system and wireless mic. You will have to get with their team to set it all up. They can also do the slideshow. They have pre-approved music, but please download a playlist just in case they let you use ours. Their list is short and the employees ""know all of the songs"" so the host would love our music if we are allowed to. :)

Electricity - Outlets in the floor.

Parking - There is onsite parking and the host is working on getting it validated for you.

Flooring - Carpet, Pallets can be placed on the floor.

You will need about 50 minutes of packing time to hit meal goal. 

The original number of volunteers was 60 per shift, but the host opened it up to 80 per shift because of interest and to help if people didn't show up. I told her that is great and we can comfortably accommodate 75 on lines per shift. I told her if you happen to have all 80 show up we will use people to help fill food, carry boxes or set up another sealing station if needed. ","9/26/23

Volunteers will be coming from a general session that ends at 4:00pm so some people might start arriving a bit early. 

The pack is 1.5 hours, but you will only need about an hour of actually packing. Host wanted the buffer time to get people on the lines and to train. 

You will have to table train 2 lines each.

Load in and the event are on the same day due to hotel logistics, the evening schedule and the short distance to our WH. We have given some buffer time for the truck to arrive late.

The room is being used for the conference lunch until 1pm and then the hotel staff will have it flipped by 2pm for our team to set up. You will need to store the pallets back of house until 2pm.

Parking - Park in Self-Parking and take a ticket. Tara with the hotel will provide a validation. I said you would be carpooling, so please only drive 2-3 cars. 

Flooring - Carpet - The hotel is putting polytac down under the pallets and the lines.

Trash - The hotel is providing trash cans but made sure to mention that the host would get an additional cleaning charge if we left a lot of trash around. I told her we were very clean and would pick up after ourselves. Please take extra care to pick up and ""organize'' the trash as much as possible. I happen to know the host is already over budget, so since we have a team of 5, I think it would be great if we could go the extra mile with the trash for this project! Thank you!

We have partnered with the school many times now. They have this annual day of service for the entire school and this year our project is for their 3rd graders.  

There will also be several parent volunteers who are not included in the volunteer count above. They are not including them because they don't want the parents doing the work. The kids should be doing the packing. The parents are only there to help support and supervise the kids. The parents can help make sure the kids are packing properly and be by the sealer and boxing area to help with troubleshooting and box counting. 

They expect 66 3rd graders.  This will put 16-17 students at each line.  They are aware that is a large number.  I mentioned to the host that the EL might ask for volunteers to assist with other activities as appropriate to reduce the AL numbers. 

They want an extended talk track (30 mins). In years past we have shown two videos which helped fill the time. They will have sound and AV set up. Please have the videos pulled up on your computer.

They also have a time prior to the meal packing where the kids decorate the boxes.  

The schedule below is the planned schedule. Over the years they have occasionally deviated from the schedule. Please be flexible!  They have plenty of time baked in to meet their meal goal.

They also cook the RLJ for the kids to eat for lunch that day. They have requested to pick up 25 bags of RLJ from 
our Warehouse prior to the event date so they can slow cook them in crockpots.  I will arrange this with Daniel. 
At the project, pull the first 25 bags from the assembly line to be brought back to the warehouse to replenish what was taken.

We are not allowed to put the wooden pallets or any gaff tape on the gym floor. They will be running the cords from the electrical outlets to a central table for us and placing floor mats over the cord.  Once we run our cords from table to table, they will place rugs over those cords as well.

The host, Jackie, is very nice but overwhelmed currently.  She hasn't opened any documents confirming times etc... so don't be surprised with some last minute changes.  I suggest the EL call her prior to the HP to engage.  The good news is the their logistics lead, Jamille Dixon, 206-496-2398, has been very responsive so I suggest contacting her if needed.

Hines, the dock operators, have agreed to reserve a designated location in the loading dock for your unload on Tuesday, Oct. 3rd and loading on Thurs. Oct. 5th. This is where all pallets will be stored before and after the HP. 
Our scheduled times for delivery and pickup have been approved. Please just check in with security upon arrival.

Unfortunately, this will be a long load-in and load-out because there is no easy way to get pallets from the dock to the event room.  Good news is that a small elevator is close to the dock and the event room.  Due to this, I have scheduled an initial set-up for Tuesday afternoon so that you can at least get the equipment and food up to the event room that day.

Details:
The loading dock elevators do not go to the 4th floor, so materials will have to be unloaded from pallets and transferred through the podium elevators, just on the other side of the loading dock entry. No Pallets will be able to fit in the podium elevator.
The distance between the podium entry on 4 to the multipurpose room is 25 ft. Immediate left from the elevators, a right turn into the PM entrance, then directly in the back.

This will be a very unique event as the meeting planner has invited two non-profits, USH and Clean the World, to participate at the same time in the same room.  Clean the World packages hygiene products  Their set-up and packing window is very similar to our.  They will have 10 ALs and approximately the same amount of volunteers for their event.  They will start at the same time as we do and end at approximately the same time as well.  All of this will be handled by a central MC controlling all of this.  I have given the MC talking points for them to incorporate into their introduction about USH.  It will be up to the EL and the MC on how to handle meal count updates and how best to introduce any box races if needed.

The only noticeable difference between the two events is that the MC will provide instruction on how to pack the hygiene boxes from stage at the beginning of the hour.  It will be during this time where our KVs and USH staff should train our ALs like we always do.  

KVs - All Table Captains will be provided by Neighboring Fridge.  They should be able to assist with set-up, table training and potentially clean-up.  Neighboring Fridge will be taking away the meals at the end of the HP. 

Event Room (Pacifica 7) - This ballroom has been newly carpeted.  The hotel will be laying plastic in the areas where the pallets will be put down.  Their breakfast ends at 8am.  Breakdown and room set up will begin then.  The hotel estimates 2 hours to complete the turnover.

Parking - The Creative Group will be providing free parking passes for USH.

Electrical - There are no outlets in the event room.  The hotel will provide access to what we need.

Sound system - Creative Group and MC to provide all equipment and play lists.

This group has packed in the past and are very excited to get to do it again!

They have asked for load in to be in the morning this time because the truck has historically been late. I told her that we would not be able to be there for load in then. She said that is fine, she has always gotten people to move the supplies from the pallets to the room anyways. Our team just needs to go there to check all of the supplies to make sure everything arrived and is being stored properly. 

You will need 2 lines using 6 meal bags and 1 line using 12 meal bags per shift to hit goal! Don't worry if you go over because this is part of the JPMC Grant and we have had some sites under pack so we have some wiggle room to over pack a little.

For MD and Load out, you will have to use carts to get everything to the loading dock. They have extra carts available to use and are hoping to get some people to stay and help, but it's not guaranteed.

Last year they had some sort of packing event and they ran out of materials very early in the second shift so they will be conscientious of that.  They should have plenty to do for both shifts.

They expect that some volunteers may need seats.  I explained that we can accommodate and the EL can recommend the best placement on the day of the event.

They would also like to make our RLJ an option for their lunch.  I provided them with the cooking instructions in advance and recommended that they take the bags packed during table training and the first several during the first shift to prepare the meals.  I also informed them that they can work with the EL on the day of the event to determine how many bags they would like to prepare for their lunch.

There will be several managers attending the conference and this HP will be occurring around their many scheduled meetings at the hotel.  

In order to reduce costs, they have negotiated 2 USH staff members for a 10 AL HP.  With that, they have committed 10 KVs to serve as table captains and 2-3 volunteers to assist with set-up and clean-up.  Specifically to help move the pallets from the loading dock to the event space which is ~ 50-75 feet over some tile and mainly carpet.

Load-in and load-out will be handled by the hotel, however, the host has requested that US Hunger do our initial set-up on Friday evening, 5-7pm, after their days meetings, so that they can provide key volunteers to assist with the set-up. 

Pallets will be kept near the loading dock after load-in.  The HP is on the same level as the dock.  It is ~50-75 feet from the dock to the event room through double doors.  The path from the dock to the conference room is pallet friendly, however, most of the path is carpet.  The hotel or the host will lay plastic across the entire event room floor before set-up on Friday afternoon.  They do not want any spilled food on the carpet even though it is dried.

Following the HP, USH will need to palletize our equipment and bring the pallets back to the loading dock where it will be stored until Monday afternoon pick-up.

PREMIERS KV commitment according to host:
Premier - Secure 2-3 ppl to help (heavy lifting) move items from holding room to event room on Friday
Premier - Secure 2-3 ppl to help (heavy lifting) move items from event space to holding room on Saturday
Premier - 2-3 volunteers to help with general set-up and clean-up
Premier - Provide plastic to the hotel
Premier - Provide gaff tape to the hotel
Premier - Secure people to lay plastic in event space/need completed by 4pm pm on Friday
Premier - 10 key volunteers to train the other volunteers “table captains”
Premier - plan for table training on Saturday morning at 10a

Sound system:  US Hunger to bring sound system and playlists.

Parking: Free at hotel.

Electricity - The floor outlets will be covered by the plastic and can't be used, however, there are wall outlets.  According to the hotel, the gaff tape can be used to secure the cords over the plastic.

Host attended a USH event previously.  They want to make this a social event where meal packing is an option over the 2 hour period.  They plan to have a band, food and potentially pumpkin carving associated during the event.  They are aware that the food/drink can't be close to the ALs.  

They do not expect all volunteers to be there at 4pm.  They also don't expect their volunteers to pack for the entire two hours.   You may decide to start with 3-4 ALs and expand to 5 as the afternoon progresses.  This HP was originally planned for 4 ALs, however, given the uncertainty of the number of meal packers at any given time, I increased it to 5 ALs and requested 12 meal bags just in case there isn't much interest.

Their facilities are very concerned about the weight of the food pallets on their floors so the host will be depalletizing our food and maybe our equipment upon arrival and moving everything ~ 100 ft to close to the event room.  Very generous!  They will also be laying cardboard where they are most concerned.  At the end of the event, be prepared to cart supplies and boxes back to the loading dock area, however, they may not be as concerned about putting several things on a pallet since most of the heavy food bags will have been used.  Once at the loading dock, there will be room to palletize and store our equipment.  The meals might be left in the corridor for the pantry to hand load.  We will need to be flexible on this one.  The good news is that it is all one level.  I added 30 minutes to load-in and clean-up in the event there is more carting than pallet jacking!.

They are also REALLY bummed we couldn't increase their meal goal.

Back up contact - Demetrice Stewart - 318-355-4514 

You will absolutely not need the entire hour for packing each shift! They ended up packing 36K last year and the host would like to beat that if possible. The grant allocation wouldn't allow for me to increase their meals BUT we have underpacked at some other JPMC projects so if you have the time, volunteers and food, you could let them beat last year's number and go to 37,000. ;)

Previous notes say the volunteers at this location were really great and fun to work with. They are a very high energy group. 

The space is pallet friendly all the way up until the actual conference room. Everything is on the first floor. They said they should have a few people help get things in the room and set up. 

One thing that will be cool about this project is that the Food bank is in the same plaza as Chase is. Last year, they popped over to see the project and said a few words. Nothing has been requested or confirmed, but please accommodate this again if they show up. 

There is a really long lunch break. She wanted it to be longer, but I convinced her to shorten it by 30 mins! You should have plenty of time to get something to eat.

Notes from previous PEARS: 
A lot of the shifts had significantly more volunteers than anticipated. We had full lines, food fillers, box shuttlers, an entire sealing table and taught them how to shuttle bags themselves. JPMC was insitatant on having all of the volunteers participate. Volunteer count was high because people signed up for only one shift but then stuck around all day. We had first timers placed on lines first to ensure they had an active role in the event and then filled in from there. 

HIGH ENERGY! Their team really enjoyed emceeing throughout the event. It reminded me of the Atlanta Hawks where it was nonstop talking, so the volunteers weren't really receiving the message but the host was thrilled regardless. They were singing along into the mic and everyone was dancing. Overall, it was phenomenal!

Many volunteers will have extensive experience packing.  Last year we had a few key volunteers help with set-up and clean-up in addition to Table Captains.  I expect the same again this year.

Unlike the past, they have finally agreed to a 15 minute break between shifts.  Previously they did not add a break. This should greatly help in achieving meal goal as the transition and training times would only allow for ~45 minutes of packing each shift.  Although experienced, this group tends to pack slow as it is a networking club and they typically have less volunteers than expected.

US Hunger will need to be present for load-in on Friday between 10:00am-1:00pm.  At that time, we are only required to move the pallets up the concrete ramp to the event room, which is the front foyer.  The path is unobstructed but on a slight incline.  It is ~ 40 yards from a street level delivery through the double doors. 

Host will handle load-out and MD on Monday between 10:00am-1:00pm.  The host likes us to keep the pallets in the foyer so that the parish members see them when going to service the next day.

Foyer floor has no pallet jack or pallet restrictions.

Parking is free in church parking lot.

There is plenty of electricity.

The event rooms, Banda Sea 1&2, are the first rooms to the left from the loading docks so load-in/load-out should be very easy.

The Lowes has just replaced their carpets so they will place plastic on the carpet from the dock to the event room and in the room where the pallets/equipment should be placed.  

USH will need to be present for load-in on Tuesday AM so they can transport the supplies to the event room.  The room will be set-up by then.  

The host will handle load-out and MD on Wednesday PM.

Electricity: Plenty of outlets in the rooms.

Trash:  Lowes will provide extra cans.

You will be in a conference room. It has shorter 4 ft tables. I told her will will need 3 tables per line then. I have not heard about the width despite asking several times. 

Load in per building: Pallets need to be broken down at the loading dock, with the contents put in c-bins or the like on dollies for transport to the event space.  Given that the floors on the office floors are terrazzo the use of pallet jacks up on the floors is not permitted.

You will have to use a freight elevator to get to the room on the 3rd floor. Once the freight elevator reaches the 3rd floor, the distance from the freight elevator to the 3rd floor Chesapeake conference room is ~106’.

For MD and load out, you will have to bring everything down on carts to the loading dock to palletize.

Due to construction, we needed a dedicated delivery for 8am on 11/14.  That is the reason for the early start time for USH staff.  The host is aware that trucks are unreliable and any delays in delivery can jeopardize an on-time start.

It is a bit longer as it is through two buildings, some turns and a few doors, however, it is all pallet/pallet jack friendly.  Very little carpet.  Host also mentioned that sometimes the trucks don't line up well with the dock so it might be a ground delivery.  There is a ramp on the dock.

Parents often bring children.  They love to have fun and take their time.  That is why extra time has been allotted for the meal packing.  You will probably end early. 

At the same time, Nona Church will also be hosting their first HP at their Narcoossee campus that recently opened.  

Upon arrival, you will go in the main entrance.  You can pull the van in the roundabout out front to load in and then move the van to the parking lot.  The ballroom is located just inside the main entrance to the right.

Meals will be picked-up at the conclusion of the HP by Servant's Heart.  Since Servant's Heart will be picking up from both locations, US Hunger may or may not still be there to assist.  The host is aware and fine with handling on their own.

Charlie is the head of facilities and is FANTASTIC! He remembers us and loves our mission and has been more than willing to help with everything!

This is the first event for our hosts, but they seem to be on top of things!

You will be packing in the cafeteria area which closes at 2:00pm. That is when you can start setting up. You will have to go through security and the host said it could take a little bit so please arrive early to make sure you have enough time. 

If you need to move any pallets during the event, please contact Charlie or the person he places in charge that day. They will have everything ready for you. 

The electrician will be laying electric for the tables and sound for you. Past pears have said this can be a lengthy process so make sure to speak to the electrician as soon as you arrive to make sure it's set up on time.

When the event is over, you will wrap everything in the cafeteria and the facilities team will handle getting it to the loading dock. They know there will be pallets going back to the terminal and pallets going to the food back. Please make sure they know exactly which ones go where. (I know it should be obvious, but our supplies have ended up at food banks before.)
