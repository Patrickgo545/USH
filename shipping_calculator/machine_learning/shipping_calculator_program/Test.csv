The room was very close to the back door which was where we unloaded. Power and sound were provided.

The supplies weren’t wrapped/secured tight enough and shifted around in the Van very easily during transport.  

Project started at 9:30am even tho packing should’ve started at 9am to wait for more people to show up. At that time however there were only about 5 volunteers present. We were short on volunteers and instead of 3 lines, we could only operate 2 lines. Everyone was very friendly, but they were very slow packers. Even after giving each line an extra sealer. I had the USH team help on the lines to aid in the packing and there were times I had the 3 of us USH members operate the 3rd line to get food packaged for the volunteers to weigh and seal. Agreeing with the host, the project ran until 11:30am to make it to at least 10k meals. I could tell 2 hours of packing was tiring for them. I had volunteers leave, and some sit down for period of time.  

If they had kept their original goal, then that would’ve been achieved and realistic.

Interaction with host was good, but would never pick up when I needed to call.

I feel like a lot of the details were miscommunicated with the event/logistics between the host and PRM and UF team. 

First impressions from the AF notes and actually on site:
Originally, it was set on the tripit that setup would take place at 7:30am; however, when the AF was finalized and sent, it had mentioned by the host that USH could not arrive before 8am because the building would be locked decreasing the amount of time we had to set up. That was not the case when I arrived on site around 7:40am. The building was accessible. We still couldn't set up because the host wouldn't pick up in order for us to locate the room either way losing that extra 30 minutes of set up time. No help came that was promised until around 8:45am. I had thought that we needed everything set and ready by 9am so that I had time to train TCs. Only one showed up at 9am because they thought they were gonna send them one by one but I told them that all the TCs at once would be great which delayed that training even more. When the host actually came to visit the site, I asked how we should hook up my laptop to show a video as requested and he had seemed clueless and didn't know what or why I wanted to show a video even though it was requested in the AF. He also wasn't helpful when it came to asking about the music and how to connect it to the AV system, but luckily we had shipped our own speaker, which we should if we have another project with UF. AF said the opening ceremony starts at 9am but it didn't actually start until 9:30am/10am. Packing was scheduled to start at 9:45am but didn't start until 10:30am because of the scheduling. Packing ended at 12:30pm. These time delays would've been an issue if we were having load out or MD pick up right after the project, but luckily that wasn't the case. 

Meals were palletized and stored in their offices and USH supplies were palletized and stored by the loading dock. 

Room was carpeted. Plenty of trash cans. Plenty of space. Plenty of outlets on the floor. 

Packing list was nowhere to be found on the pallets.

Emma was great and stayed throughout set up, meal packing, and clean up. She thanked us for a great event.

The students at this university are super passionate about volunteering! Many of them showed up 30 minutes prior to the first shift and several of them stayed after the second shift to help clean up and reassemble the bin kits with USH staff. Their university is known for their students' service hours, so they would be a great partner for future small or large packs! The key volunteers were great and super enthusiastic about cheering their teams on; some of the key volunteers only stayed for one shift, but they trained a replacement before leaving. We had more than 12 students per line for the first shift, so we were able to set up another sealing station to keep up with the amount of bags being packed. For the second shift, we were able to fill 4/6 of the lines, so we used the last 2 lines to seal bags. About 20 minutes into the shift, we were caught up on sealing, so 6 students started a 5th line to pack meals. We finished about 10 minutes early for both shifts and had plenty of time to take photos and talk to the students. 

In terms of set up, all the tables and several large trashcans were set up upon our arrival. The pallets were also placed into one corner of the room and already unwrapped for us.

It was expected but because we weren't there during load in our stuff was in a different corner from where our event was taking place. The organization Meals on Wheels needed to set up but our stuff was in their way. Their project started and finished within the time we set up and had our first shift. We had a couple of people confused as to where to go. We felt that some signage would've been helpful for this event. 

Project flow: 
We had many volunteers ready to go as soon as it was start time. There was a nice area for them to wait but the line did get very long and people seemed anxious about being let in. We had a wristband system which did help with the volume of volunteers we were interacting with. There were many present for other events so having the wristband system allowed us to quickly identify who was with us. 
Shift 1: We thought we had fewer volunteers than we actually did and started placing them on the line with 8-10 to a line. Once we finished the line and thought everyone was at their place, we had a wave of maybe 30-45 more folks walk in through a different door. This caused confusion for them and us and we just started filling up tables to the max. We also decided to open up another line and another sealing station and we still had people waiting to get placed. Maybe 30-40 min into the project we started to let people know to join us for the second shift because we did not have anything for them to do.
Before shift 2, I asked the people handling registration to only send people through the original door we were using. This helped a lot because even though there were more volunteers during the second shift. We set ourselves up better the second time around. During the shift change, there were plenty of people just hanging around, and most of the KV’s left because they were hungry. We had sufficient time to clean everything up and reset for the second shift but everyone was just anxiously staring at us ready to get rolling.
Shift 2: Dispersing the volunteers into the second shift was a lot easier. I would count them out and send 14-16 to a table at a time. I would keep groups together and everyone would find something to do at their table. We had fewer KV’s but the USH staff helped with training all the tables.

Please use this field for any additional information you would like us to know.
MD: The driver was very kind and arrived on time. The driver was super appreciative and explained that they would love to receive meals from us again.

USH Staff: We were accurately staffed for the event. The carpet made things more difficult and we needed to move it across the hall for the load in the dock so all 4 of us pushed every single pallet. We also had help from different volunteers from Meals on Wheels and our host.

Key Volunteers: The KV’s were excited to be there and took the position seriously. In between the two shifts, most of them got hungry and left. We had roughly 12 at the beginning and around 5 for shift 2. 

Loading Dock: The loading dock was very close to the hall where we had the event. Although the corner we had for the event was further away from the loading dock, it was a better setup for volunteer flow. We had a dedicated entrance and which helped with the traffic.

Straight shot, easy to maneuver.

The space wasn't pallet friendly (as expected), but we were able to park the pallets just outside of the room which made unloading quick and a short distance.

Set up was quick and easy! They had the tables, table cloths, power and trash cans ready for us upon arrival, they were on top of it! 

The baby black pallets were helpful. 

One of the ramps/lifts from the loading dock was incredibly steep and required a bit of extra man power to get the meals loaded onto the truck but it was doable.

KV's: The first batch arrived late so we had to go through an expedited training. The second batch had a trickling of people and it was important to one of the hosts that they all get involved so even though it wasn't necessary to have that many trained up for the second shift, we had to frequently pause and get everyone up to speed. The second group wasn't catching on at all and was more interested in their own conversations so they worked together to train one table while our team trained the other 3 because they were a little behind meal count at this point and we wanted them on the lines quicker. The host was ultimately okay with this and was grateful that we included all that were interested in the KV training. 

The lines were VERY full. There was a fair amount of people rotating roles to ensure everyone got to pack. They helped with filling, moving boxes and taking pictures. 

Already planning on doing another event with us later in the year (I believe they said October). VERY excited about it. They shared that this event always sells out for them and they have a waitlist. Pictures from our previous event with them were displayed in their hallways beautifully. We were definitely their focal point in the hall. They're wanting to increase meal count next time. 

Their mic was pretty poor quality, I'd suggest sending ours next time. Their music sounded great though. 

Since we were shuttling the completed meal boxes outside of the room to palletize, a second cart would have been helpful.

The host is a little nervous about hitting the volunteer goal, but is optimistic. To hit meal goal, we are doing 10 lines with 10 people each. You may need to do some box races. She is also nervous if the first shift packs too many meals and the second shift only gets to pack for 20-30 minutes.

Our push cart was also broken. A wheel had snapped off from the cart. This possibly happened during transit. Especially when we needed a push cart the most, it was broken and made it harder for the team. 

Pavillion was not 10 feet from the parking lot when we loaded in as stated by host on AF. It was more like 30-35 feet. The concrete path was still slightly steep. It was hard to pull up a pallet of lentils that was only half the size of a full pallet of lentils. Luckily the truck driver had an electric pallet jack and helped us bring it up to the pavillion. However! As soon as you got to the top to the pavillion, the concrete path decreases in width and built up ice was blocking the way for us to load in. The host could've cleared the area before our arrival, but instead USH staff were breaking the ice and clearing the path. But because the concrete path was small and tight, the pallet jack and pallet kept getting stuck in the mush/mud. We had to lift the heavy pallet everytime to get it unhooked. Again the host could've cleared the ice and laid down plywood to aid in load in. All USH staff were extremely exhausted and it was freezing out. 

We damaged part of the wall and the snow shovel they had trying to break the ice hill.I wouldn't say the host was upset by it but it was probably not her favorite part.

Also, a lot of the pallets kept breaking.

Set up went as planned. Set up was smooth, we had enough electrical outlets that were easily accessible. The room was spacious enough for the event. When we arrived for load-in the tables were already set up for us. The host did her part.However, KVs would've been super helpful for table training. We tried slowly having volunteers flow onto tables so we could train, but instead all the volunteers just decided to all leave and get on the tables all at once without allow us time to smoothly train.

The loading dock is a long, straight shot at a steep incline. The semi was able to fit but there wasn't any wiggle room and they were limited to one of the three bays to pull into.

The slideshow was great, they loved the addition and many commented on it. 

MD: So great getting to see Chris Lee, kinds words all around. They had an electric pallet jack which was helpful. 

They had a pretty split mix of high school aged students, older volunteers from the rotary club and then a small handful of children. 

There were more markers in the coloring box than normal but we purchased an extra pack just in case since it was specifically requested. 

They had their own sound system and mic, worked very well and was clear! 

Could have filled an additional line easily, but since they were packing so quickly and many volunteers paused to take breaks or rotate out, it worked out really well sticking to the planned number of tables. 

Plenty of outlets available, and the low carpet made it easy to lay power. 

Quick packers! They finished roughly 10-15 minutes early, which the host was more than okay with and the Rotary Club was thankful for because the fatigue was sitting in. Lots of chairs were used for volunteers. 

Security: Never checked our ID's during load in, and Ashley met us in the lobby for event day and recognized me. ID's weren't checked then either. 

JOY to work with! The high school students were eager to jump in and help. They clearly took a lot of pride in their role and often asked for a second set of eyes to quality control the bags. 

There was one group of older folks from the rotary club that were being rude to their high school table captain. They've done the event before and weren't really allowing him to table train. It was settled and ended on a positive note, but they were pretty negative and loud for about 20 minutes. 

LOTS of volunteers made a point to come up to our team directly throughout the event and after to praise the team for how energetic and smooth the event was going. 

One of the older tables stopped packing early because they were tired to we cut the project early to get a group picture including all of the clubs, and had one of the interact clubs stay back to finish the remaining 2 boxes. This was a smooth ending for everyone and the high school students loved sticking around on their own to complete the goal. Positive experience all around. 

We were calling up representatives from each of the groups to give the meal count updates, they LOVED this and everyone was quick to pull out their phones for this. Definitely do this next time! 

Ashley was surprised meals got picked up today and was under the impression that was happening on monday, rather than at the conclusion of the project. 

BOL's were available on the drive, but were not printed for us. We had to print them off at our hotel.

It is a small high school club that spends time finding ways to serve. They are all eager to participate. 

One thing to note from last year's PEAR is that they actually are dismissed from school around 2pm, so a lot of them showed up early and ready to go and we were not set up yet. I mentioned this to her and she said we can't get in to set up before 1pm, so we will keep it at 3pm and they will have to be patient. Just set up as quick as you can, and tell them they will need to wait. 

You will need to go check at the office and bring you ID.Then you will drive around to the cafeteria entrance and load in there on carts. 

Last years PEAR mentioned that they unloaded in the car loop and had to walk a distance to the cafeteria. She told me you can unload through the cafeteria doors, so you should do that to make it easier.

Several students stayed after packing concluded to assist with reassembling the bin kits properly and bringing the supplies outside so that they could be palletized in the sprinter van.

They are getting student leaders to be the KVs. We requested 14 and they think they should be able to get at least 10 who will be able to stay for both shifts. I said our team could fill in the extra 4 tables if they couldn't get 14.

There are 2 sets of double doors the pallets will have to go through. The will take the crash bar out of the middle so they are pallet friendly.

Either Marie or Steven will start each shift with prayer. Then our EL can give the track talk and instructions. 

You will need about 50 mins of packing time each shift to hit meal goal.

They would love if MD and Load Out can be complete by 3:00pm. I told them we would need at least a 3 hour window, so that is why we are starting load out only 30 minutes after the last shift is over.

Our team just had to maneuver the pallet jacks a specific way but we were able to get through it with little struggle. 

Do you have any comments in regards to set up?	Set up was smooth and we had sufficient time to get everything ready.

Do you have any comments in regards to load out? The loading area was ground level and requires a truck with a lift gate. I believe for load out the semi-truck could not pick up the stuff due to that fact.

Project flow: The biggest pain point was getting the students onto the line and ending the event. For the first shift, we were placing them on the lines after the talk track by counting them out. This just ended up taking a long time because there were so many of them all at once. For the second shift, we had a USH staff assign them a number before entering the gym which helped a lot. 
Ending the event was difficult because the traffic of the students entering and leaving was nearby each other. For the second shift, we had the students all place their belongings on the opposite side (near the bleachers) which helped us send them all in one direction.

Volunteers: We ended up creating a sealer station because they were overwhelmed quickly. They were slow and fast packers scattered throughout both shifts. They seemed to have a good time and enjoyed the music.

Meals Distribution: MD was quick and on time. Right at the end of the event they arrived.

USH Staff: We were appropriately staffed for the event.

KV: The KVs were students that needed volunteer hours for the National Honors Society. They were present right before the event to get table training. They all understood their role well. Afterward, some seemed a little stressed out due to other students not listening but they all seemed to enjoy it.

Event space: The gym floors were smooth for our pallets. The available power cords required a lot of gaffing. Parking was straightforward and easy. We struggled with the sound system due to a bad aux cord but they had a different one for us to use and it was very good. The mic was cordless which also helped a lot. 

Packing list: Steven mentioned that during the building of the project, a conversation about us bringing an aux came up. In our green bin, we didn't have one. We did have a spare mic but no aux.

Suggestions: 
1. Having the students have assigned table numbers might benefit this group considering they all show up at the same time and are doing the hp as part of their class day which gives us more assurance that they will all show up. OR plan to have a USH Staff assign them a number at the door.
2. If this group does multiple shifts again, I suggest having the first shift place all their belongings on one side so that the new students coming in for the second shift have an uncongested pathway into the event.",32 miles,No,Astra,8,"10,600 lbs",Other,Box Truck,$700.00,$700.00,$0.00,$22.16,$2.77,$0.00,Yes,,3,"2,500 lbs",SEFL,LTL,$650.98,$650.98,$0.00,$20.61,$6.87,$0.01,No,the client had an event that shut down the parking lot the first time. the second-time driver didn't feel comfortable making the turn. third time it was picked up,"$1,350.98","$1,350.98",$0.00,Yes,,Over,$0.98,100%,No real reason,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,,1/2023,1/2023,3.445,1/2023,3.445,False

We need to try and make up for it this year the best we can. 

This is a very rich private high school. Dacel was a KV at 9/11 NYC and is passionate about service. She is the one who brought this to their school. Each shift will be a different grade, last year they said some grades were friendlier than others. Expect them to be picky about the music. 

They also packed fast last year and the last shift wasn't able to do much, she wants to make sure that this doesn't happen again, which is hard because their meal count is low. Do you best to get creative and stretch it out, you can cut some shifts a little early, just make sure each grade gets to pack. 

The building is not pallet friendly. You will need to unload on the street, and cart everything inside. Then you will go up a slow elevator to get to the space. Last year they said the staff was very helpful and brought extra carts to expedite the process. 

Not only was the shipment not picked up on time last year, it took 2 days for the truck to come. The client had to hand unload everything in and out of the building twice without us there, so it was a rough situation. We are hoping this doesn't happen again. 

Contact for load in is Dacel, but the actual facilities person is Liza Lanzi if you happen to need her.

Photo Op: The students are in advisory groups (roughly taking up a full assembly line). The teachers wanted the photos to be done by advisory groups and didn't think the space accommodated a large group photo, we agreed. 
The microphone was atrocious, truly unusable. Great wifi! The sound of the music was great. 

MD was difficult to get ahold of but were wonderful on site. They loaded into two personal vehicles and had half a dozen volunteers meet at the school to assist in loading. 

Dacel is very interested in volunteering again for 9/11 but was disappointed last year fell on a workday weekday. She'll likely take the day off to ensure she can go again. I encouraged her to reach out to our team if she was having difficulties becoming a KV. 

The red hairnets were a nice touch, matched the school colors. 

We had to remove 4 juniors from a table because after multiple touch points, they continued to seal anything and everything they could get their hands on into the meal bags, including but not limited to scoops, hair ties, sharpies.... This was very much not the norm for this group. For the most part the students were lovely, respectful and eager to participate in the project.

The venue did have a pallet jack, however they only had one that we did have to share throughout the event process.

The distance from the loading dock to the event space was only about 30 yards and was pallet friendly however two door ways were a tight fit and the pallets could not have any overhang in order to get them through the entryways. One of the lentil bags was ripped while moving the pallets from the loading dock to the event space.

The venue did provide electricity however they did not gaf the lines and the outlets were not placed underneath the tables. The microphone box with the speaker connector was not included so we did have to purchase a speaker and Bri was able to project without needing a microphone. The tables were set up nicely but there was limited space at the ends of the table, however, enough for us to place a pallet. The trash cans were not provided until after set up and we were only provided 2 trash cans, however we utilized larger bags and managed.

The host assigned the volunteers table numbers beforehand and with the space we had this made starting the project smooth. Even without the microphone the volunteers were very polite and listened when Bri had something to say. This was a very fun group and there were several people who had been at TD Securities previous packing event with us years ago. The event was for the company as a whole and had many representatives from around the world (including Singapore). We did not have access to the venue's wifi to pre-download the spotify track. There was no security check at any point and the loading dock attendant could've been more informed on the logistics of the trucks and how to contact our team when they arrived.

The venue laid down power, but the outlets were awkwardly placed in the space between the table rather than underneath the tables. The host wanted to keep the tables where they were so we just added additional gaffers tape. 


The host mentioned that they're wanting to host a HP in Toronto, Canada. 

KIND group of volunteers. One of the most respectful groups I've ever had. They gave us their full attention and it made it really easy to navigate without a microphone. 

Didn't have access to the wifi, download the playlist beforehand. 

Valet experience was easy, even with someone from our team having to leave and come back to get the speaker. 

The host assigned table numbers and wanted them to go straight to the lines where they stayed for the talk track. This made it easy to expedite the intro to get them packing quicker.

8:30 am - set up KVs arrive (5-8 KVs)

9:30 am - 18 table captains arrive to be trained. These table captains will not only train lines, but also help clean up after the HP.

10:00 am - volunteers start arriving and go to dining hall for breakfast and presentation. They will register and be given an assembly line number. The school is handling the registration. 

10:30 am - presentation begins in dining hall. USH EL may be asked to speak for about 5 minutes. (bring with you the clean up instructions to use as reference for clean up.) 

(They do a great job with this presentation time. They really take the extra time to be sure the volunteers are educated about WHY we need to care, give, serve...)

11:00 am (approx.) - everyone heads to gym. 2 USH team members greet them at the door, pass out hairnets, and direct them to assembly lines.

Will need about 45 minutes of packaging if lines are full. Could be 10 - 13 per line - depends on actual volunteer count. May want to offer a job switch 1/2 way through. Ask Buck about competitions - in the past they said they didn't want any competitions.

>>>This is super important...client really wants USH to redistribute boxes so that all lines finish up at close to the same time. In years past, there has been 10 - 15 minutes between when first group is done and last group. Causes an awkward period of time. 

Instruct table captains and all participants to use the printed clean up instructions on the back of the assembly line numbers taped to the table. Client wants everyone to help with clean up. 

They will also be preparing our meal for a sampling. (We mailed them the meals already.)

We arrived to tables set up with the tarps already on the ground, ready for us to go! 

Buc and his colleagues were convinced that the tables were too close, and we explained how this has always been the minimum amount of spacing and even showed him the extension chords and talked through how it was plenty fine and what we normally do. They were surprised by this, but ultimately were fine to do the spacing we recommended and needed.

They had 20 assembly lines/tables set up. We were anticipating using 18 lines, but Buc preassigned the volunteers to tables and that only accounted for 15 lines. He was adamant on only running 15 lines, which we agreed to and it was ultimately fine. We used an additional table to set up as a sealing station which helped tremendously. Some of our team helped by solely sealing, this kept the client happy. 

Buc is retiring! He was relieved and excited about this being his last project because he's ready to retire to fish! Praised our team for years of excellence.

News crew on site, sent over to Sarah immediately. 

They do a big intro before the event including trivia with the families, this was really engaging and received well. 

In order to have all the lines finish at the same time and not exceed meal count by too much, we cut the event 5 minutes early and had a handful of volunteers who wanted to stay to help load out pack an additional 2.5 boxes. This made the host happy and we were easily able to work around them while we actively tore down. Great experience.

This project is part of a huge week of projects for JPMC Commercial Global Services. They have locations all over the world and everyone will be participating in some type of service project over the course of the week. In total I believe they are packaging over 500,000 meals, 335,000 of those are with U.S. Hunger.

They really want documentation of the food going to the food banks. Please remember to get a picture with MD. This can be of the meals being loaded on the truck, you with their staff picking up, or whatever  creative idea you have. We just need a few pictures to send them at the end. Bonus points if you can get their logo in the picture! 

You will have to do a ground load in outside. It looks like a shopping area, you will just pull up between the buildings and will have to load in about 100 yards away from the building. DO NOT GO TO THE DOCK! They said the space you are packing in is on the ground floor and is pallet friendly.

We were in a different space last time we were here. This room is pretty small so you won't have a ton of space. They also don't have a projector to show the slideshow we made. 

We will not be there for load out. Please explain the load out process, that there will be 2 separate trucks coming and which pallets will go with which truck. There have been times that our equipment was sent to the food bank, we want to avoid that as best as we can.

We didn't need to go deep into the JPMC building so the path we needed to take was short. There was a tricky curve but the truck driver handled it.

We had the KV's help during set up so it went by quickly.

We weren't present during load-out and the poc wasn't available because he was in a dentist appointment. No one was there to sign the bol but the security guard guided the driver as to where to go once in the building. I was on the phone with the driver guiding him to the correct building. There is an AMC theater right next to the entrance and I believe that it is the best marker for getting to the right place.

Project flow: Finished 15 min early during the 1st shift, 30 min early on the 2nd shift. There was no mic for us to use but the room was small enough to were projecting my voice was sufficient. They were good packers and had lots of fun.

Volunteers: 1st shift: 80 2nd shift: 59

Meals Distribution: We weren't there for MD.

USH Staff: We were appropriately staffed
KV: Ended up with 5 for the 1st shift and 6 for the 2nd.

Loading doc: No loading doc but loading was easy due to where the room was. We didn't need to go through there security so we had plenty of space.

Packing list: We could've used 25lb measurements rather than 55lb on salt

Parking: There are multiple garages around the JPMC building. During load-in, we parked at the one closest one to the building but they weren't able to validate it because they don't manage that garage. The correct one to go to is building 720.

Final meal count: 25,140, 87 full boxes, 14 extra bags

For next time: Ensure that the next team knows that the correct building to park in is 720. The easiest way to find the building we had the event was with the AMC theater nearby.

The last time we were at this site the load in was complicated. We thought it was pallet friendly, but it wasn't. We are loading in a side door instead of the dock to make it avoid breaking the pallets down.

He didn't utilize the campus map that was sent to him, so we didn't actually get connected with him and start unloading until it was closer to 1:15pm. The forklift was great! The distance from the truck to the packing space was roughly 100 yards. 

The concrete that we were allowed to have our pallets on was the same as the packing room, so I'm not sure why we weren't allowed to roll them into the space. Unloading was physically taxing and time consuming, but exactly what we expected. The room was really tight on space so housing all the food to be used for the event maxed out the room. Seven tables worked really well, would not recommend adding more. The only reason this space worked well was because we were able to roll the food out to pallets just outside. We wouldn't have had room to store completed meals in the packing area. The outside area did have a roof covering so even though it was raining, the boxes were fine. 

Lindsay was a joy to work with! Very communicative, high energy and a wonderful hostess making sure we were taken care of and fed.

Staffing was great for this project but we needed more of the team to stay back for load out. 2/6 had to leave early to catch another project. However 3/6 left shortly after the packing ended to go to the airport when their attendance was really needed. Loading meals and load out was too much for one person. Physically, that's too much for one person, but the 3/6 that left for the airport to go home after also missed out on the experience of earning how to tear down and load out. 

The forklift was ready for us upon arrival. Ran smoothly, no problems. They came early to pick it up which was fine. It would have been nice to use to load for meal distribution though when the lift gate went down. They picked it up between noon and 1pm. 

Their wireless mic worked great! The sound system was a bit delayed in adjusting the volume, but this is plenty fine to use moving forward. The host used their own device and they had issues downloading their own playlist so occasionally there would be a lull to buffer but we were pretty quick about jumping on the mic to fill the gap so I don't think it was an issue really. Their playlist wasn't the normal 'JPMC' one, this one was great!! Much longer and high energy. 

The slideshow didn't play through. They had issues downloading it in different formats, so it just stayed on one screen that we'd occasionally click through. 

They had valentines available and treats, very cute environment. 

We counted people onto lines outside of the space, and did the talk track with them on the lines. For the most part we had a good retention of attention even though we had them on the lines. 

2 carts was great, 3 may even better next time if available. 

Some of the table numbers were actually the quantity number signs from the full cart box builds, which we knew was a chance.

They have locations all over the world and everyone will be participating in some type of service project over the course of the week. In total I believe they are packaging over 500,000 meals, 335,000 of those are with U.S. Hunger.

They really want documentation of the food going to the food banks. Please remember to get a picture with MD. This can be of the meals being loaded on the truck, you with their staff picking up, or whatever  creative idea you have. We just need a few pictures to send them at the end. Bonus points if you can get their logo in the picture!

They will need to do some 12 meal to hit their goal unless they are faster than usual. You will only be able to pack for about 45 to 50 minutes to leave room for transition time. I would feel it out as you go and switch to 12 meal as you see fit. You will have enough to do 50% of the meals if needed. 

Will be 1 6' and 1 8' table for each line. The room will be tight, but we wanted to be able to get 100 volunteers per shift.

Load in and out will be a doozy. In all honesty it has never gone well at this building. You will be unloading on the street near 21 S Clark St, there is an elevator that will bring you down to the space. The elevator is not pallet friendly, so you will need to cart everything up. This is a heavy lift for just our team, so they are providing in house movers to help you and to bring extra carts. I am told it should be 5 or 6 of them, but we are still confirming that. We should also have a map to show you where the elevator is on the street.

For load out we will have to see how load in goes. I think our equipment will need to be loaded out the same as load in. The food bank has a truck that will fit in the dock, but is 9 inches too short for the dock. We will have to hand load down into to the truck from the dock, but they will have 3 people to help. If it turns out the street load in is easier, we could do that instead. Let's talk before Thursday to decide.

THEY WILL NOT SEND A TRUCK THE RIGHT SIZE. Do not even go that route, just make sure they get Charlie involved and he will make sure Advantage Movers takes care of it. Basically we will ship to an offsite location in Chicago, and they will bring it to and from the actual building for us.

The loading area is complicated. The truck has to enter the dock through an entrance across the street. The dock is below ground level and the supplies are brought into the building from below below ground using a freight elevator.

The freight elevators lead to the lobby and then the supplies had to be carted over to a regular elevator to be taken down to the event space.

Load in was complicated as expected ahead of time. Instead of the supplies being delivered the day before the HP (2/14), they were delivered the morning of (2/15). There also was a lot of confusion about how to get to the loading dock. The entrance is located across the street from the Chase tower and a security guard has to be notified that delivery is approved ahead of time. Only delivery vehicles are allowed through that entrance. The dock can be accessed from inside the Chase tower if security or personnel take you down using the elevator. There are pallet-friendly freight elevators that can be used to bring pallets up to the main floor. The issue was that the event space could only be accessed with a regular elevator, so once the pallets were brought into the main lobby, the supplies had to hand loaded onto a regular elevator.

We finished early!! The JPMC team was SUPER helpful!! Charlie brought all of the pallets up from the dock to the elevator for us to hand load. Several other employees helped us move all the supplies down to the event space, going up and down the elevator with bags of rice and lentils. A few employees also used the stairs and carried boxes and lighter supplies down.

This HP went way more smoothly than we had expected! The JPMC staff were very, very helpful. We had more than 4 KVs, but only about 4 stayed throughout all of the shifts, so USH staff had to table train for the last few shifts. There was a great turnout for every shift and the employees were genuinely excited to be a part of this event- we had to slow them down for the last 3 shifts because they were packing faster than we needed them to. Also, at the request of Alec (the executive who wore the heart suit), we packaged at least 102,000 meals. He said they would cover the extra cost but the Chicago branch wanted to beat the branch in Plano. Logistically, this was a difficult project for load in and out, but Charlie insisted that if his team had been included in the planning ahead of time, there would have been no issues and the supplies would have been placed where they needed to be. Maybe he can be involved in future planning, especially since they like to move everything to the secondary warehouse location.",976 miles,No,Astra,10,"16,000 lbs",Multiple,Box Truck,"$3,400.00","$3,400.00",$0.00,$3.48,$0.35,$0.00,Yes,,3,"2,700 lbs",Estes,LTL,$954.19,$954.19,$0.00,$0.98,$0.33,$0.00,No,,"$4,354.19","$4,354.19",$0.00,Yes,,Under,-$895.81,83%,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,2 box trucks for 1700 each and return 954.19,2/2023,2/2023,3.501,2/2023,3.501,True

This was the most difficult JPMC site we had in all of 2022. They have a lot of requirements for their building and we had a lot of issues with the load in and out. I believe this should not be an issue this time, but be ready for anything. 

They have a standard height dock and freight elevators to get everything up to the space. They say we need to be in charge of moving the pallets, but last time the facilities team was happy to jump in and help. 

Meal distribution said they want to come in and introduce themselves and thank the group. JPMC is excited about this added touch!

The tables were already set up. It was a small room and our supplies fit rather snugly. Made it easy to fill though because everything was so close. The supplies and food fit well with a little space for volunteers, we just didn't have room for a good photo. We went into the hall for one shift, but it really didn't make it much better. 

They laid down power for us. We would have done a 'prettier' job of it, but their porters were insistent and wanted to help out.

She loved it and can't wait to do it again. Adamant that we need to book 6 months in advance for her to secure the larger room.
Please use this field for any additional information you would like us to know.
We weren't expecting key volunteers, but the host wanted to recruit them. We taught a few early birds how to do it and they stuck around for the second shift. 

FUN and lively group! The first shift was really full on volunteers so we created a big sealing station and had them collecting their own bags. 

The powerpoint was fabulous. Their sound system was clear and we loved having a wireless mic. 

Had to hand unload everything out of the room which we expected. 

Very straightforward project, smooth sailings with the exception of the truck not coming when expected. 

Load In - truck showed up right at 1, unloaded easily.  Porters helped to transport pallets up to the hallway, we had to hand load everything into the room to set up. They brought the tables in at the same time to make the next day set up easier.  Host was very kind in trying to accomodate us the best they could with the smaller sized room.

Load Out- truck showed several hours early while project was still going on, asked him to return at 4.  Driver did not show up, came back the next day and was 2 hours later than the pick up window. The security guard required us to obtain a pass for removing supplies from the building. Facilities manager, Jim was helpful in getting this for us and speaking with the guard.  Heads up, that this will be needed on the next project, apparently needed for everything exiting the building. We had one for our supplies and one for Meal Distribution.

Meal Distribution- After confirming months in advance, they changed the pick up day and time a few days before the project to pickup the following day. Because of this and because our supplies were already loaded out, we had to load everything onto carts and bring down to the loading dock to restack onto pallets.  The MD driver showed up 3 hours early and was upset that he had to wait until the scheduled time. He was also insistant everything had to be stacked back on a pallet and was upset that it wasn't wrapped (because our supplies were gone before we could load out meals).

Load in will be a little challenging for this one. You will be unloading in a lot behind the building and will have to cart everything in. No pallets are allowed. You will need to take an elevator once inside to get to the second floor. 

They can show a slideshow, but not from a mac. If you don't have a PC to show it on, let me know.

The only other thing I wished we had was a third person. They would've really helped with holding the doors open and the elevator.

As soon as we did the set up, you can tell the room was too small. It was just enough for the 4 lines but if they hosted another event and wanted more lines. I wouldn't suggest a room smaller than that one. 

The truck driver arrived an hour before the scheduled time. They said they were going to leave but we went back and forth with him about staying. He left to get lunch and then came back around the scheduled time. During this time we were stretched thin. The event was ending and we also needed to shuffle everything downstairs to palletize and wrap. This moment is why we felt we needed more help.

Electrical/sound: The room had power on the ground which made it easy. We were able to present the slide show but needed an hdmi, the host didn't have one that I could use so I went to an office depot to buy one. I'll keep it with me to prevent situations in which we have to leave a project because it can be stressful.

Project flow: It took about 10 minutes to get everyone who was supposed to be on the shift in the room due to check in and selecting shirt sizes. They were completely full on all 4 lines and packed very quickly. They had a good time and seemed to enjoy themselves. 

Volunteers: Fast packers 
1st and 2nd shift ended 15-20 min early

This can be of the meals being loaded on the truck, you with their staff picking up, or whatever  creative idea you have. We just need a few pictures to send them at the end. Bonus points if you can get their logo in the picture!

We went to this location last year and they are one of the few who handles load in and out for us. What a dream! There were no notes about this being an issue last time. However they have expressed a lot of concern about the pallet being too heavy. I think they are all set, but either way you aren't in charge of getting everything to and from the space.

The only thing I said you would help with is loading out the meals. This will be happening at 4pm as their dock closes at 4:30pm, so they were concerned with timing. Please start taking meals down earlier if you can, but I told them you will help with that load out to make sure it goes smoothly. Our supplies you can leave in the space for them to handle.

There were no KVs on the AF however, we received about 8 Kvs from the host

The host was really involved and excited to be there. He was very helpful and great at communicating. He was a little nervous about the project but we reassured him that things would go well. Overall, the project went smoothly.

---------

Do you have any comments in regards to load in?
Prior to arriving. Load in was handled by the host. They apparently had to unpalletize everything and hand load the supplies to the room on the second floor. The food was not set on the black pallet, which they were also no where to be found when we arrived, but they were back at the loading dock. There is a freight elevator accessible but the conference room has a small slope/ramp which I am assuming is hollow because they did not want to push the pallets over the ramp in case of it breaking. Last year they did it on the 1st floor in the cafeteria which is pallet friendly. This year was not pallet friendly because the packing was on the 2nd floor.

Do you have any comments in regards to set up?	
Set up when super easy and fast. About 30-45 minutes because the host had a lot of extra people to help us.
Do you have any comments in regards to load out?	
Load out was fairly easy too since they had a moving team help us transport the completed meal boxes and our supplies back to the first floor.
Please use this field for any additional information you would like us to know.

Set up went smooth. There was a lot of gaffing with the placement of the lines.

Load out was tricky as both trucks arrived early and this impacted the pick up line for dismissal. It was a half day for the students.

The host was great and very energetic. He has done this many times and kind of took over on the mic.

One line was set up with 2 ping pong tables. The host said that they use to have 25 tables, but when setting up they found they did not have that many anymore. We made it work. Since the ping pong tables were so wide, we set up 2 sealers because there was no way the kids could reach the middle of the table with one. This helped a lot in the 2nd and 3rd shift when the older kids were there and we were able to move bags to that line for faster sealing. 

The KVs arrived on time and I trained them. It was super fun to have kids be the table captains. Most of them took it seriously and asked a lot of questions to make sure they were doing a good job. There was one little girl who go very overwhelmed for training and just stopped training in second shift. The EL and I noticed this, so the EL started training the table while I reassured the girl that she was doing a good job and helped her feel better prepared for the last shift.

The schedule we were given said that we had 45 minute shifts, but the host said he only scheduled them as 30 minute shifts. I talked with him and said we would not meet meal goal if we keep them to 30 minutes. He agreed and we adjusted the times to be 45 minutes.

Shift 1: 8/10 lines - 1st and 6th graders; Arrived 15 minutes late, then the EL did a 5 min track talk. By the time we got them trained, they had about 10-15 minutes of packing. We only packed 9 boxes in the first shift.

Shift 2: 10/10 lines: 2nd and 3rd graders; Arrived 5 minutes late. We decided to save the track talk for the end. The host agreed and this time he just sent the kids in by class and had them go straight to a line. That worked best! They ended up packing the full time and no track talk.

Shift 3: 9/10 lines; 4th and 5th graders; Arrived on time and packed for 40 minutes. The classes ended up leaving when their table was done even though we got on the mic and asked them to pack bags to help out their neighbor table. Since they were leaving by table, there was no track talk for this shift either. 

The EL was only on the mic one time for the track talk at the beginning of the first shift. The host and myself started jumping on the mic to give directions and encouragement.

Sound: The sound system they had was a small portable speaker with a wireless mic. The mic was great, but it wasn't very loud so the music didn't really add to the project.

Coloring Committee: The PreK and K classes actually came into the gym to decorate the boxes instead of us sending them to their classrooms. I gave them boxes to get started, but the host and the teachers kept going to the stack (even with our sign on it), assembly lines, the food pyramid and the pallets to get boxes to be colored. I asked them to please come get me when they needed more boxes because I needed to keep track of the count. They didn't. They just kept getting more and more. It was very difficult to keep track of how many completed boxes we had and how many more boxes we needed to hit meal goal. 

The host told me in the last shift, before I knew the trucks were early, that there were faculty meetings in the gym at 1:00pm that day so we needed to be out by then. I told him that our load out window was until 3pm and we couldn't guarantee that the trucks would arrive at the beginning of the load out window. I told him we would figure something out when we needed to. Luckily it worked out because the trucks were early. 

Clean up was a frantic mess. Because they had staff meetings, their specials and admin staff along with some 4th graders started ""helping"" clean up. They were moving like items to one assembly line or just moving one lines worth of supplies to another line to start taking down the tables and sweeping. I didn't realize what was going on until I finished wrapping the 2 meal box pallets and could stop it. I do not know what the other 3 staff were doing that they did not see this happening. 

People were also walking around with no hairnets and we still had open food. Once I saw this, we got the food to one area quickly and ask those without hairnets to help in another area. 

Open Food: There are 3 bins so open food. During the shift, the 2 support staff members asked me if they could go ahead and open an extra bag of rice and lentils because some of the lines were getting low. I looked around and told them to go ahead. I guess that gave them the confidence they needed to feel they could just keep opening more and more food as they didn't ask me to open anymore and at the end of the day we had way too much open.

Overall, it was a good project and it was nice to see the kids packing the food themselves. 

I got the feeling from the host and some of the teachers that they had done this so much that they didn't really need us there to help. They knew what to do and could just run it themselves.",5 miles,No,Other,4,"5,000 lbs",Big Bull Delivery Trucking,Box Truck,$400.00,$400.00,$0.00,$73.53,$18.38,$0.01,Yes,,2,"1,500 lbs",Big Bull Delivery Trucking,Box Truck,$400.00,$400.00,$0.00,$73.53,$36.76,$0.05,Yes,,$800.00,$800.00,$0.00,Yes,,Under,-$100.00,89%,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,,2/2023,2/2023,3.501,2/2023,3.501,False

He was able to switch out trucks and still make it back within the window. 

Had to hand unload into the elevator which was time consuming, which we expected to do.

set up: One of our teammates had to go get a speaker. The other waited in the lobby to run it up while the EL stalled, dragged out the talk track and entertained waiting on the sound system. 

Tables were already set up, very easy room layout. Plenty of power options.

A truck that was too big came to pick up the supplies at the conclusion of the project but had to be turned away. Astra/3PL/ Blakely(from Astra) said they didn't have a truck that would fit the loading dock, which is untrue because Estes was able to get one. The hill was too steep to move the supplies up it. 

A truck was supposed to come the following day, it didn't. Pallets are still there 4 days later. 

We weren't expecting to have KV's but ended up having roughly 5 rotating in. They were fabulous! 

Alec, the man that spearheaded this week from JPMC was on site. Raved about our team and events! Said they ran like a machine and he had complete admiration for the team. 

Two carts was helpful, would strongly recommend this again. 

Meal Distribution picked up from the street and utilized their lift gate. There wasn't a ramp in front of the building, however they used their electric pallet jack to bring it to the end of the block without any problems. We potentially may need to plan to have our supplies get picked up with a lift gate in a similar fashion. 

It was important for Alec to have the JPMC bring out the boxes, and we were thrilled for the help. They helped bring down carts and carried completed boxes to the lobby for us to palletize quickly. This worked out really well. 

We were often trapped because we needed badges to navigate the building but the host never really wanted to stay with us. She often 'dropped us off' and then we'd have to interact with strangers to get us to where we needed. It was effective, but time consuming. 

We could squeeze in 7 or 8 tables in this space moving forward, but I wouldn't recommend doing more than 5 again. It fit nicely.

Set up took a lot longer than it should have. We had 2 new support staff members who had never been on an HP before this project. They moved a little slowly as a result, so we needed the full 3 hours to get ready for the event and set up all 14 lines.

The host/staff at CSUSB thought the driver would handle getting the pallets to the loading dock even though that was never communicated by the PRM. The driver did not arrive on 2/20 as planned, so the shipment has not been picked up as of the writing of this PEAR. Additionally, because we did not reach meal goal, we had a lot of food to ship back to the warehouse, so 5 instead of 3 pallets are beings sent back.

This was a fairly difficult project logistically. Crystal (the logistics contact) was very adamant about us leaving the tables as they were set up ahead of time, but the tables were placed too far apart. She claimed they were spaced 5 ft apart, but our regular extension cords could not reach the outlets they had laid out for us. I believe the tables were spaced 5 ft apart vertically but not horizontally. She was displeased that we had to gaff between the lines and that we did not have the most recent site plan they had created. This confusion slowed us down for set up. Crystal was also unclear about the process involved with load out. 

We did not hit meal goal for a couple of reasons- CSUSB overestimated volunteer interest and set long packing times that they did not want to adhere to once the HP started. On day 1, with drop-in style it was difficult to maintain a steady pace of packing. We had approximately 5-6 lines out of 14 filled the entire 4-hour shift. Staff from the Community Engagement office assisted with training and sealing throughout the day, which was a huge help. We reached 26,308 meals at the conclusion of day 1. For day 2, we had a different contact (the alumni director instead of Cam) that initially said she could guarantee 100 volunteers. We only filled 7 lines out of 14 lines the second day with approximately 70 volunteers. We also started about 20 minutes late because the majority of alumni arrived after 9:10am. We did not have any KVs the second day, but the staff who did check-in assisted with sealing about halfway through the HP. I told the day 2 contact that we would have to pack about 49,000 meals to meet the goal and she asked if that could be done in 2 hours even though the shift was scheduled for 3. After she saw the turnout and that we were slowly making it to 50,000, she told me many of the alumni would likely leave at 11 ahead of the free lunch provided and requested I end around then. I announced our meal count to the volunteers and asked that they stay until we hit at least 50,000 meals- the HP ended a little before 11:30am at the director's request. Clean-up took a while due to the amount of open food we had. At the request of the staff (and with PRM approval), we donated most of the open bags of leftover food to the MD partner along with the packed boxes, so we only sent about 2 bins of open food back to the warehouse.

--------

Overall: 
Overall this was a good project for our volunteers. For Day 1, we had about 7/14 lines going. This was interesting since volunteers were coming in and out. For the most part, there was a steady 5-7 lines. For Day 2, we had about 8 lines going. The host informed us that they didn't have as many volunteers as they were expecting, so we broke down 2 lines the day before to help with clean up. On day 1 we packed ~26,000 and on day 2 we reached ~56,000. The host on day 2 wanted to end early since 3 hours was too long. We wrapped up after a little over 2 hours of packing. The logistics contact and her event team were waiting on us to finish and couldn't attend another event since Meal distribution and cleanup took so long. The meal count was not reached due to the low volunteer count. The EL did box races and we tried to keep up the energy but we could not make up for it. 

Setup/clean up took a little bit longer since both support staff had never been on a project before. Doing so with 14 lines did get a little stressful since a portion of the time was refreshing them. I would recommend extra support for next time. 

Meal distribution took longer than expected since the lift gate was large and hard to make flat on the school's loading dock. The host requested that we give leftover food to the food bank since we did not reach the goal. The lift gate was starting to dip when a pallet was on it. We were worried about breaking the truck so we couldn't give them as much. We decided that giving them open food was best and since we had so much of it open from not being used on the empty lines. 

Logistics/Gaffing: 
I do not believe that the hosts and the logistics contact were communicating very well which made the project more stressful than need be. Our logistics contact was more persistent than our hosts were. Crystal was adamant about where the tables were set up. When she saw us move tables her team came over and explained that electrical was set up specifically set up for the floorplan. When we explained that the tables needed to be 5 feet apart, she said that we didn't have the “most updated” floor plan. We agreed on a minor change, but the section of tables was so far apart that every table needed an extension cord, but the tables were not 5 feet apart as the bin kit cords did not fit. So each table had a unique gaffing setup. The electricity was also placed in the center of the room meaning that the gaffing was right through where the volunteers were walking, which in my opinion was not the smartest as they were very concerned about someone tripping and creating less of a mess on the carpet with tape.


Load in/out: 
Load-in was handled by the host. The logistics contact was Crystal. Crystal and the host, Cam was not on the same page. Amanda made it clear that the school and facilities team was responsible for the load in and out. This would mean getting the pallets from the event room to a long hallway to the loading dock. Crystal explained that her team was not responsible for getting the pallets inside, but did so out of kindness. She explained then that she will also not be responsible for getting the pallets to the loading dock for load out the following Monday. I updated Amanda and she communicated that they are in fact responsible for load out. Load out is pending due to driver issues.

Parissa Renkin stated that USH team was supposed to vacuum the room or they would be charged, however, that was not in the agreement form. We did it because we had time and we wanted to be nice.

Jori and I caught multiple people drinking/eating on the line. The buffet was right outside the event room so people were coming in with food or drinks. 

No BOL was printed for our pallet Jack so Bri allowed Kim to write the info on the paper and attach it to the pallet it was on.

-------

Project flow: The start of the event was chaotic due to the volunteers not having assigned tables. Once they were all on the lines some table captains started training while others didn't. I then gave them the signal to start training. I want to say that during packing time was the smoothest portion. Things got trickier toward the end. The host wanted their own pictures with the whole group but needed to wait for the director to come out and close out the event. The issue was that the event and meal goal were met well before the scheduled time so there was a weird gap in which the volunteers just stood around because I was asked to hold off on the announcement. They eventually allowed me to close out the volunteers and thank them for being there. I then asked them to wait for the closing remarks on the opposite side of the room to give our staff more space to start tear-down. As we are all shuffling around and trying to get the room cleared out for their picture the director comes out for his closing remarks. They then take the pictures and head on out. The host thanked me and hugged me afterward so she at least seemed happy (I counted it as a win!) but the beginning and end were just a bit chaotic.

Volunteers: There were around 250. There were no assigned tables so the start was chaotic because as they were all trickling in, the host asked me how many to a table so there was miscommunication with that. We didn't control the music so there were times I wished the music was different to keep the energy high but outside of that they were engaged and seemed happy to be there.

Also, there was a buffet/drinks right outside so they kept bringing in their drinks even after being asked not to.


Meals Distribution: The driver showed up right on time and helped us with loading the pallets onto the truck.

USH Staff: We were perfectly staffed for this event. We needed a lot of support to get it all done in the time given.

KV: There were 14 kv's, they came in a bit late so I didn't have too much time to train. We ended up getting the volunteers into the room a bit late. 

Loading doc: Was a bit far away from the room. We needed 4 people to move pallets, sometimes more when they were very heavy. The host helped us to get another pallet jack that was electrical, through the FedEx office, which helped a lot. We couldn't operate it but it helped us get the pallets out.

Security: When we first got into the hotel the host helped us get to the conference room. At the end of the event, when we were moving pallets the security folks asked us to sign in with them. In order to get the parking validation we needed to sign-in and then sign out. 

Packing list: Not having black pallets for so many lines was a bit rough because you couldn't really tell where the food was or which sides needed food or were going faster.

Host: Parissa kept pushing us to vacuum the room after the project and she was very concerned with the fees associated with cleaning. Before the project, she was also very concerned about the pallets messing up the hotel carpet. We don't feel she understood that it wasn't part of our agreement to clean we did vacuum a little to be nice.",24 miles,No,Other,6,"8,300 lbs",Big Bull Delivery Trucking,Box Truck,$425.00,$425.00,$0.00,$17.86,$2.98,$0.00,Yes,,4,"2,700 lbs",Big Bull Delivery Trucking,Box Truck,$425.00,$425.00,$0.00,$17.86,$4.47,$0.01,Yes,,$850.00,$850.00,$0.00,Yes,,Under,-$150.00,85%,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,,2/2023,2/2023,3.501,2/2023,3.501,False

So, you will only have them for packing between
6:00-7:00pm and 7:30-8:30pm.

You are going to have WAY more volunteers and time than you need. This is what the client wants, though! There will be families, so maybe with the kids the packing rate will be a little slower. They can take their time getting in from the fellowship room and getting started. You will for sure not need 2 hours to pack all of these meals!!! Play games to slow them down. You will probably also have time at the end to take some good group pictures. Maybe even have the first shift help straighten the lines for the next shift. They also said some of their high schoolers would love to help with logistics during the event.

This was due to the fact that the room where the talk track was happening vs where the event was happening was far apart so task needed to be divided and conquered for sure. It was nice to have plenty of leads to rely on.

Project flow 1st shift: During this shift, we had about 525 volunteers and filled all 32 lines. They were packing very quickly. We did a game of musical chairs to slow them down. We ended about, 20 minutes early to take pictures and reset. They did about 51k.

Project flow 2nd shift: During this shift, we had about 230 volunteers and filled 28/29 lines. They packed at a decent pace. Unpacked boxes had already been divided evenly to all the tables and the beginning of the shift but we then needed to move them around again to account for those couple of tables that were empty. We then were shuffling them again to account for the pace at which they were packing. They did end a couple of minutes early and completed the 99,686 meals.

Volunteers: The volunteers had a great time, they had high energy and were excited to be there. Some of them asked about where in Ukraine the meals were going so it will be nice if they can get an update on that. This group also had a lot of people in wheelchairs/scooters and we learned that the 5ft between tables can be restrictive for them. We just placed them wherever there was the most amount of space.

USH Staff: We needed many hands for this project and I'm happy to say we were staffed perfectly!

Remember: no U-Line branded equipment can be in site on the assembly lines or with USH's extra stuff. We've ordered new supplies to ensure this doesn't happen, but if you come across something - you'll need to remove it or cover the name.

KV's will arrive at 7:30 am on event day for training. USH team should be onsite by 7 am to prepare for event day.

Volunteers will not be preassigned. This is a required activity for the Grainger employees, but it is optional for their guests. As such, it's unclear exactly how many volunteers will arrive. This is required for approx 315 vols. Expect at least 150 guests to arrive as well. I'd start with 10 - 12 per line.

We were able to pick up and unload the rice, cart, and 2 rented pallet jacks prior to the truck's arrival, so once it did arrive, we quickly moved all the pallets. The valet area was pretty congested. They had 3 large buses that arrived to pick up passengers and the employees wanted the area completely clear, so it would have been complicated if the truck had arrived earlier. Additionally, the ramp up to the ballroom was pretty narrow. It just fit the width of a pallet. Since the ramp curved to the side, you had to carefully pull the pallet up so that it would not get stuck. We avoided using the ramp as much as possible for meal distribution. The driver and hotel staff helped us move the pallets quickly into the event space with their electric pallet jacks.

Load out of USH supplies went very smoothly. We set up all 6 pallets right by the valet area and the driver arrived soon after we loaded the van to return the rented cart and pallet jacks. He used his electric pallet jack to load the pallets into the truck.

MD: The trucks did not have a liftgate. I asked the POC to come as soon as he could once I confirmed MD about 30 minutes into packing. We palletized the completed boxes, loosely wrapped them, and moved the pallets over to the trucks to be hand loaded.

Caitlyn was great and answered any questions we had right away. She was disappointed in the ULINE label on the harinets, but seemed overall impressed with our services and the event.

Despite challenges with truck delays and the lack of a liftgate for meal distribution, the project went very smoothly and seemed like a huge success for our team and Grainger! The hotel staff were very helpful and communicative. Even though there was a lot of loading and unloading in the valet area on the day of our load-in the valet staff were understanding that we had a delivery window and would quickly unload so that they could continue accommodating staff excursions. They also helped us find parking, move some of the pallets with their electric pallet jack, and checked in on us often while we were waiting for trucks outside. 

The HP itself went very smoothly! We had just enough rice to fill all the bins and set out pallets for the remaining lentils and veggies needed during the packing. Due to the carpet in the event space and the amount of boxes to be packed, we palletized the completed boxes outside. As a result, we did have some staff gathering boxes and moving them outside throughout the event. Feed My Sheep came about 1.5 hours earlier than scheduled since they confirmed that their trucks do not have liftgates. Their staff/drivers assisted with loading all of the boxes and seemed thrilled with the donation.","4,670 miles",No,Multiple,13,"18,000 lbs",Multiple,Multiple,"$6,516.45","$6,516.45",$0.00,$1.40,$0.11,$0.00,Yes,,6,"4,700 lbs",Multiple,Multiple,"$4,442.43","$4,442.43",$0.00,$0.95,$0.16,$0.00,No,DHX missed the sail date from the small island to the big island,"$10,958.88","$10,958.88",$0.00,Yes,,Under,"-$19,041.12",37%,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,Hawaii HP.

They will be hosting this after their Sunday service and it is open to everyone. They have worked with us for several years and always seem to have a great turnout! I would expect a lot of families. They usually have very helpful KVs and the shifts are always full or overfull. You shouldn't have any issue hitting meal count. 

The space is very easy to navigate. There are 3 buildings on campus and fellowship hall is it's own building, he said you can't miss it. You will need to pull all the way to the end of the U driveway and unload right outside of Fellowship Hall. It is a short distance and pallet friendly. The custodial staff should have a space designated for you to stage the pallets. 

The only issue with this group is that they are not the friendliest. They are loud and not great listeners, so you may have a hard time getting them to listen to the talk track. They have strong personalities, so just be kind but firm with them. Father Alex and Frank are both very nice and the team has said great things about them.

We have done a project with them before in 2016. That AF doesn't mention anything about packing upstairs.

Parking/Load In: 
The room is located upstairs and there is NO ELEVATOR. She said they had people who could help carry the supplies up the stairs. I have requested 5 people to help with load in and out!

Even though it's only 2 lines, I have included an extra 30 mins for set up because of the stair situation.

There are no truck size restrictions for the warehouse. They would like you to park at the bottom of the ramp and they will bring a forklift to get the pallets off the van and take them as close as possible to the stairwell!

To reach the event space, we’ll enter the building from the warehouse and go approx. 20-feet to the stairwell. Once to the top of the stairs, the meeting space is about 50-feet away. 

They have 2 loading docks (dock height), a forklift, 2 electric pallet jacks, and several rolling carts to assist if we need them! I would use the carts at the top of the stairs so you don't have to carry the supplies once you are upstairs as well!

________________________

Notes from last years PEAR:
They were short on volunteers for all shifts. I talked to Jonathan about this and he is going to try and ""oversell"" each shift so there will be room for people who don't show up.

We do not have access to their wifi. Please download everything!

Jonathan was an amazing host. He help set up, fill food, move boxes, etc. He was so sweet and accommodating. So awesome! 

MD ended up taking all the pallets including our USH supplies. Since the host is handling load out for us again, please make sure to fully explain what pallets are MD and what pallets are ours. I know it seems obvious, but please make the extra effort to make sure they understand. Their facilities team will be handling this, not Jonathan.

We are part of their daughter's Bat Mitzvah. The service is at 10:00am and we have to be done setting up by then because they would hear us setting up during the service. You will have some time to take a break or grab a quick bite to eat.

Participants could start getting to the room around 11:45am, but they don't want to start packing until 12:15pm. There will be tables set up for the lunch they are hosting afterwards that people can wait at.

To start the pack, their daughter Eden will want to say a few words before we give our track talk and instructions.

They may have more than 120 volunteers and we may send extra lines, but they cannot increase their meal goal. They understand that this will shorten their packing time. I told them we could do the ""musical chairs"" game to help slow packing down if they are packing too fast.

MD is coming on Sunday right after the pack. We will have to help with this. Do not wrap the meal pallets until MD arrives. You may be hand loading their truck... Sorry!!!

The volunteers will be eating lunch right after the pack in the same room. The host is ok with us cleaning up while they eat lunch. She said last time we were super speedy and quiet, so it was great!

Host will handle load in!

We have packed with this group before, but at a different location. They have moved to a new building to help make load in easier! This team is very excited for the project and really fun to work with!

You will load in the front double doors. There is a ramp up the sidewalk. Once you enter the building, you will store the pallets in the training corridor overnight.

The event is happening in their cafe area and we cannot have access until 1:30pm due to lunch. You will be setting up while people are still eating lunch, but it is less busy at 1:30pm. Due to this, the tables will not be set up for you starting at 1:30pm and the pallets will not be in the event space. I have requested 4 KVs to help with set up because of this. They should arrive at 1:30pm.

Floor: Concrete - Host will lay something under the pallets.

Sound: The room is equipped with sound and a wireless mic. They did ask that we keep the volume at an appropriate level because they share the building with other tenants and they have been asked to keep quiet at previous events they have held.

Electricity: You will handle, they said outlets are accessible.

Parking: Please park in the main lot. There is no cost. You will need to check in with security when you arrive. I would suggest arriving early on event day due to the set up situation.","05/18/23

They do have a small site, so it will be a very small group. We are packing 12 meal to accommodate. 

April is one of the BEST hosts I've had the pleasure of working with! She is so excited and passionate about service!

They have a garage door where everything will be loaded in and out. This is close to the event space which is at the front of the building. 

SECURITY: They are VERY strict about security at this location. She said you will need to show IDs and sign something when you go in. You will not be able to bring your cell phone past the front lobby. You can bring a laptop for music only, but tape will need to be placed over the camera. You will have to sign non-disclosures to enter the packing area and have bags checked both upon entering and exiting.

I went on this project last year and had a great time! Leaving my phone at security was not as big of a problem as we anticipated. The packing room is literally right inside the door closest to security, so I was able to step outside to check my phone periodically to check to see if any drivers had called me. There is a landline number that we are giving the drivers to call as well in case they can't get ahold of you. (607-621-4100) The host provided a calculator for us to use to keep track of meal count. 

ROOM: The room was one of their work rooms and we used the tables/desks they already had in the room. They worked fine. There were some employees who had to work in there while we set up, but they were not bothered by us. It might feel a little tight, but it worked fine.

PHOTOS: We were not allowed to take photos for security reasons.

2nd time at this location. They are VERY excited and very competitive. Other than NYC, they are packing the most out of all the other sites who are participating.

This is for Citi's annual Global Community Day. For 2023, they are doing HPs at 9 sites across the US and packing over 650K meals. Since 2017, Citi has packaged 2 million meals with USH. Celebrate that!!

--------

event space - main area is the Town Hall. There are air walls that open up to a smaller event space across the hall. We are planning for 14 lines in the main room and 6 across the hall. They are literally just separated by a wide hallway. It will feel like 1 large space - just spread out a little. There is an elevated stage in the main space as well.

electrical - not a lot of wall outlets, and they said they are connected and often blow the circuits. They know what we need, and said they would talk to their facilities team and get it figured out. You might test this during set up the day before.

sound - they have it; 2 event spaces share the same sound system and speakers are in both areas.

trash - asked for several trash cans to be available when we arrive

parking & security - park in the visitor lot or North parking lot. This will be free. Proceed to main entrance. Follow the signs. It takes a little bit of time to park and walk into the building. Allow some extra time. All staff will need their ID for security. They'll give you a security badge. Someone from Citi will need to escort you to the Town Hall, which is on the main floor.","Load in and set up on Monday, June 12. Tables will be set up for USH when we arrive.

This event will count towards their community service membership goals. There will be ~ 200 adults, primarily mothers, also attending the conference as their conference proceeds the teen conference.  However, other than a few KVs, they will not be participating in the HP.

The host will be providing 10 KVs.  4 dad's/mom's will be present for set-up starting at 12:30pm.  6 teens will be selected as table captains for both shifts and will arrive at 1:30pm for table training.  Host also said that there will be many mom's & dad's available for load-out since the timeline is tight from end of project to pick-up. 

USH does have to be present for load-in on Thursday.  Unfortunately, there is no direct path from the loading dock to the restaurant that is pallet friendly so we will need to take the pallets through the prefunction space, down to the lobby, and then back over to the restaurant. There are a few rugs in the back hallways. There is a carpet in the meeting space that they do not allow motorized pallet jacks on.  It is approximately 350’ from the loading dock to the restaurant. The rice will need to be stored somewhere else the night before so this will add to the distance it travels.

The HP on Friday will be held in a restaurant at the hotel.  
The room has enough space and tables for 6 ALs, however, the table sizes and lengths vary (see below).  I suggest that the EL view the area on Thursday evening or Friday AM to best advise on set-up.

If all volunteers participate, there will be 16 volunteers/table.  The host is open to having some volunteers help with restocking and moving boxes to reduce congestion at tables.

This is the last day of the intern's weeklong orientation. They are doing this because past participants have given feedback saying they wanted a ""give back"" event as part of orientation. 

The hosts are wonderful to work with, but have not participated in a project before. They also work at other JPMC locations, so they don't know much about the facility. So, there are the hosts, the facilities manager and the ""district"" facilities manager who all have opinions about how this should go. Luckily, we have been done projects at this site before and the people on site have been very helpful to us in the past. 

The district facilities manager has made it VERY CLEAR that we are to get pallets on and off the truck. Once they are off, the JPMC porters will take care of getting them to the event room. We have to use a freight elevator, which has a 1,000 lb limit so they have said that we will have to make them all half pallets before moving them to the space. The room itself is not pallet friendly so you will have to unload pallets to get the supplies in the room. 

The load in window is small because their dock is ""so busy."" We also can't take the supplies to the room until after 5:30pm due to the conference room being occupied until 5:00pm that day.

They will lay electric for us.

They say we don't need tablecloths but past PEARs said they are wood tables, so I am sending them just in case.

Sound - In room A/V. You should be able to play the slideshow.

Flooring - Raised Floor

*The host has not said anything about low volunteer count and with the 4 shifts, you should have plenty of time to do a track talk and hit meal goal. However, when talking with the entire planning team I keep getting the feeling that the volunteers will be late to each shift as the conference/training is more important to them. So, I requested 12 meal bags be sent. The warehouse team is able to send 2 boxes of 12 meal bags. Each box gets you 16,800 meals. This is the back up plan just in case! Please try to use all 6 meal bags and only switch to 12 meal if you are far behind!

They are not doing it as part of their family day this year, but the volunteers will still be employees and their families. People are coming in on their day off, as well as some coming before their shift. 

The PEAR said that last year they were packing kind of slow and the host confirmed that. We quoted this as all 12 meal bags based off that the fact that the CEO wanted to increase the meal goal by 5K from last year. If they pack at a normal rate, you will for sure not need the 2 hours, but the host wanted to leave it that way just in case. I foresee you not getting started right on time and with it being families it will be good to have extra time!

The space is kind of like a bay garage with big doors that can come down. Host confirmed that there are swamp coolers in there, so hopefully it won't be hot.

They are handling load in/out for us and will bring the pallets to the space for us. I have reminded her several times that the food pallets have to be stored in A/C before they bring them to the packing area on event day.

Parents often bring children.  They love to have fun and take their time.  That is why extra time has been allotted for the meal packing.  You will probably end early. 

Different from previous years, the HP will be preceded by a  worship rally from 8:30am-9am.  This is where the congregation will come together outside the venue to reflect on the day of service they are about to embark on.  Following the rally, the parishioners will disperse to one of several charitable activities planned for the day.  One of which is our HP starting at 9:15am.  Five KVs will be excused from the rally at about 8:50am for table captain training.

Upon arrival, you will go in the main entrance.  You can pull the van in the roundabout out front to load in and then move the van to the parking lot.  The ballroom is located just inside the main entrance to the right.
Meals will be brought back to USH for pick-up the next day, Monday, by Servant's Heart Ministry.

They have done this project several years in a row and they are a fun group, especially the host!

This is a two day project. The schedule and meals packed per day will look the same both days. 

Per day
20,000 meals
4 lines
2 shifts
50 volunteers per shift

They have had issues with getting volunteers to actually show up in the past, so I highly encouraged her to over recruit! I told her if she recruits 60 people and all of them show, we will still be good with 15 people per line. 

IF by chance you have all full lines and can over pack, please do it! We have had a few other JPMC Goodworks Grant projects not hit their meal goal by quite a lot, so if we can make up some of those meals here, that would be awesome! No pressure though!

It is kind of an interesting location. You have to load in on an indoor track to get to the cafe where the project will take place. The space seems to be easy to navigate, but just a lot walk across the track. 

They have also had questionable tables in the past because they use the cafe tables. Please make sure that the table with the food bins on them are sturdy!

Parking - Visitor Parking - free

Wifi - always tricky in JPMC buildings, please download your playlists

Slides - The room has screens, so please use the USH slideshow.

They are very nice, but previous pears say they are very slow packers and don't always get the full volunteers for the full time. The host said that last year the feedback was that 1.5 hours was too long so he is adamant that it is only an hour this year. I told him we HAD to have 3 full lines of volunteers in order to make that happen. I suggested he publicize for 45 people to ensure we have enough in case people don't show up. The room is not big enough to add any more lines.

I would highly suggest starting with 2 sealers on each line in order (extras have been requested) to help with possible sealing bottleneck and to make sure they get done in an hour! This will also help if one stops working on a line for a bit, they will still have one that can keep going.

You will be able to take the pallets up the freight elevator to the 28th floor, but you will have to load it onto carts to take into the room as it is not pallet friendly. I am having them send an extra cart for you. You will have to store the pallets near the loading dock.

As for security, it seems like this location is more relaxed. However you will need someone to escort you around as badges are needed to let you into different spaces. Please also make sure to have your ID!

electricity - plenty available

trash - they'll have cans ready for us, and they'll empty during the day

flooring - low pile carpet; it's new, but nothing USH needs to do to cover it. no pallets.

parking - visitor parking area out front. You will have to check in at security and get name tags.

The direct path from the room to the loading dock (approx 800 ft) is not suitable for pallets. The doors leading from the conference rooms to the parking area are too narrow for pallets, so boxes will need to be moved on flat carts to the east parking area where they can be palletized and moved by forklift.

The host has requested 2 sealers be placed on each line. Please do this! They are very concerned about the ""back up"" at the sealers and have are very adamant about having 2 sealers at each line. They also want extra sealers around the room, but I told them 2 sealers per line will be great! (They packed with another meal packing organization in the past who structures their assembly lines differently than us and they think their sealing model works better.)

They will also be placing a chair at the end of each line for the boxes to not be on the floor, so their employees do not have to bend over to fill the boxes.

This is not the first time we have been to this building, but it is this department's first time packing with us. The reason there are so many shifts is they thought this was a more ""come and go"" packing boxes of already packaged food and could have it out over a weeks time. This was the compromise we came up with. I know it's not ideal, but the hosts are really excited about it and they are trying to make it fun!

The host is handling load in for us. Their facilities team will take all of the pallets to the event space for you! They will also have to make MD and our supply pallets down to the loading dock at the conclusion of the project.

Security is a big deal at this location!
When you pull in, show ID to the guard. Come straight into the main entrance and park in visitor parking. North end. Follow the walkway to main entrance and you will meeting host, Lisa, to check in at security and get a temporary badge. You will have to be escorted everywhere.

Packing is on Floor 3B in the common area at the front of their office space. They want the event to be fun, but please be mindful of the music level as others will be working.

They are having a employee appreciation cookout alongside our project. They will both be happening around the same time in the same location, but she said the people packing will stay on the lines the whole time and others will be filtering in and out for food. Just don't expect the food people to jump on and pack. 

The KVs won't be table captains, they are just there to help set up and with any logistics needs.

This will be outside under some tents. Their facility is 24hr, so they will be working in the warehouse and will not be shutting down for the event. They also can not guarantee PVC particles would not be in the air. Their team will move the pallets outside to the tents for you. They have a generator to plug in the sealers and the sound system. They are renting the sides for the tents as well in case of weather.

Since you will be outside, I am sending tablecloths just in case you need them for the tables or to cover things. :)

You should not need the full 2 hours for the event, but we built in some buffer time.

They are handling load in/out for us. I have instructed them that all food needs to be placed in A/C before and after the event. 

-----------------------------------

Parking - The front of their building is for Amazon. You have to drive through the back fence to get to the gravel parking lot. They are Dock 8.

No Wifi - Please download your playlists!

Trash - They will bring cans out for you

-----------------------------------

It is scheduled as one shift just like last year, but here are some notes from last year's PEAR: Volunteers :The volunteers came in shifts from work even though the project only had 1 shift. The first group of volunteers packed about half of our meal count and then they were dismissed to take a group picture and eat. While they ate we also had the next shift come. Support staff and I trained but the best part was the volunteers from the first group had so much fun that they came back to help pack more by choice. It was so fun and the volunteers had a great time talking , packing, singing and dancing. We had 4 people help set up that also packed on the lines during the event.

I talked to the new host about this and she said it would be one shift, but I wanted you to see what happened last year just in case it ends up happening again.

This is somehow connected with JustServe as well, which is an LDS church service platform.

They did a very small 15K HP in 2022. They have a 20K sq. ft. space reserved, with set up on 8/11/23. It is air conditioned.

Goal is 750-1K volunteers - mostly youth ages 12-26. The volunteers are actually signing up for 3 hours shifts. Meal packing is 2 hours and the other hour is lunch and a concert. Could be some of the same volunteers or a new group. Could be 1K-2K total volunteers.

KVs:
The host is recruiting 25 Set Up KVs and 100 KVs per shift: 70 for Table Captains, 30 for Logistics

There will be a site plan for the tables. There will be 7 groups of 10 lines with colored tablecloths: Black, Red, Blue, Green, Orange, Purple, Yellow. The volunteers will get a colored name tag with their table number and colored section. 

The venue has a forklift that the host is renting for load in/out. Our certified people can drive. 

They'll handle getting the MD partners. The first round of MD orgs will come at the end of Shift 1. There will be a lot of them and some are only taking a few boxes. We will get a list from the host so we will know how many pallets to wrap and how many to leave open for the smaller orgs to grab from.

They have a DJ/emcee lined up but we will have access to the mic for box races, meal updates, etc.

They will have McDonalds for breakfast on event day and probably Pizza Hut for lunch. We are welcome to join if there is enough!

We will have to assist in setting up tables, so I am having the KVs come at 8:00am so we can get the tables set while we wait for the trucks. The host is not sure how long they will stay, but at least they will be there to help get us started.

Electric - There are many outlets around the room, but it will be a lot of gaffing. The venue will have their electricians on site on set up day to drop boxes closer to the lines.

Sound - DJ and Stage

This is the first HP for AVI-SPL Dallas.  However, they will be joining AVI-SPL Tampa who has participated in HPs for many years.  AVI-SPL Tampa will also be packing 20K 6 meal packs during the same time.  This will be broadcast at both sites as they try to sync the events together.  However, for planning purposes, these are being handled as 2 seperate HPs with 2 different AFs.  The hosts will let the day of event leads know if they want them to coordinate anything regarding joint box races etc. during the HPs.  NOTE: Time change if looking at Tampa event.  Times will appear 1 hour later (EST).
AVI-SPL Tampa always has 2 ALs, 3 1 hour shifts and always finish packing 20K 6 meal packs on-time.  They move fast and are competitive.  The host of Tampa insists that our staff can assist the tables in packing, however, past PEARS have indicated that some volunteers have gotten upset when other teams won prizes after receiving assistance.  Your call!!! 
Since this is Dallas's first HP, they might not be as fast as Tampa.  If that is the case, the hosts are fine extending the packing time of each shift 5-10 minutes, except the last shift, since there is 30 minutes between shifts.  They rather do this than incorporate 12 meal bags.

Recently, Dallas requested that USH completes are portion of the load-out by 1pm because they will be closing the building for an off-site event starting at 1pm.  One hour after the event concludes.  I informed them that I can't make any guarantees but that we will try.  They will leave one person behind to lock the facility if needed.  As such, they are fine with US Hunger palletizing the equipment and meals inside the event room.  They will transport the pallets to the doc for pick-up.  They will also provide KVs to assist in clean-up if needed.  However, with 2 ALs and plenty of time between shifts to load the meals, it may not be needed.  Again, your call!

They always have 2 ALs, 3 1 hour shifts and always finish packing 20K 6 meal packs on-time.  They move fast and are competitive.  They have asked to purchase FCE/USH merch as prizes that will be sent by Kiara ahead of time.  The host, Vince, insists that our staff can still assist the tables in packing, however, past PEARS have indicated that some volunteers have gotten upset when other teams won prizes after receiving assistance.  Your call!!! 
Thay have added a new twist to this year's HP.  AVI-SPL Dallas will also be participating in their own 20K meal pack during the same time.  This will be broadcast at both sites as they try to sync the events together.  However, for planning purposes, these are being handled as 2 seperate HPs with 2 different AFs.  The hosts will let the day of event leads know if they want them to coordinate anything regarding joint box races etc. during the HPs.  NOTE: Time change if looking at Dallas event.  Times will appear 1 hour earlier (CST).
Since this is Dallas's first HP, they might not be as fast as Tampa.  If that is the case, the hosts are fine extending the packing time of each shift 5-10 minutes since there is 30 minutes between shifts.  They rather do this than incorporate 12 meal bags.

Parking - Plenty of free parking in lot.

They will be loading in for us and leaving everything on the dock overnight. The event space is on the same level as the dock and they said it isn't too far of a walk, but it is carpet the whole way there. They also confirmed that the floor is pallet friendly and will have a pallet jack for you to use if needed. Last year, we had to cart all of the lentils and rice down since there was a 600lb weight limit for the floors. We were able to use the pallet jack for the pallets with other supplies.

They had several carts we were able to use. The room only has a single door, so we will have to unload all pallets into the event space and then store the pallets on the dock. 

There were several extra volunteers each shift last year so we had some of them help us take completed meal boxes to the dock to be palletized.

You will have KVs to help with set up and tear down. Last year several people just offered to stay and help clean up. If they are able, get them to help with moving supplies to the dock area.

They are making a fun day of it and having it at a park. They are renting a tent.  

This project is more complex than most with load in and out. Unlike the other Barrette locations, they are a normal office and do not have space for a project. They will be hosting offsite at a park where we can't leave the pallets. You will be going to rent a sprinter van to pick up the pallets at terminal nearby, and dropping them back off after the project. 

They are a fun group from last year's PEAR.

The host did request to increase their meal goal, but with the sprinter van limitations we can only go as high at 15K. If they are rockin and rollin and you can pack a few extra boxes (within our normal overage limits) I'm sure that would go along way to make the host happy. BUT there is no expectation or pressure from me for that! :)

--------
Notes from last year's PEAR I found helpful:

The tables were set up outside in the grass underneath a large tent. The morning dew made the tables rather wet, we had to dry them off with some paper towels from a nearby bathroom. The ground was a bit uneven, not anything to be concerned about, it was a very slight hill that it was on. Due to the tables being wet at first, supplies slide a bit on the table. As the sun came up more, the area dried and it was no longer an issue.

There was a building 15 yards away where we ran power to. The concrete was very challenging for the gaffers tape to properly stick to. For outdoor projects we should send the gorilla's gaffer's tape, it does a great job of sticking to the concrete.

The grass was still wet from the morning so we put the boxes at the end of the line needing to be packed on top of broken down boxes from set up in order to keep them dry. 

We were able to pull the van up right to the tables so this was a smooth set up. 

The carts were more so used to hold the completed boxes at the end of the line to avoid them being on the damp grass. There were extra volunteers who wanted to float around so they carried the boxes over to the pallet for us. They made it incredibly easy for our team.

-----------

The project is a hour later this year so maybe the dew won't be as much of an issue, but I am still requesting our team send paper towels just in case. I am also requesting they send the gorilla's gaffers tape for electrical and and extra cart. I have also requested tablecloths just in case you need them since it is outside and the tables are rented.","08/24/22

There is an elders class in the Hall that will end at 10:30am.  They will be making their way out of the hall at that time.  It is okay for you to begin your load-in at 10:30am as they begin to depart.  Please just be mindful that it will be an elderly crew so be careful!  Because of the class, you may need to assist with setting up the tables.

They normally host this event outside in the winter, USH insisted on holding indoors due to summer heat.  In 2022, they held the event without USH staff so they are experts.

This is part of missions day so there will be other activities occurring on site.

Host will handle load-in and load-out.  Upon arrive, we should enter the worship hall through the front doors.  The West Fellowship Hall is down on the left.  Call Marc when you arrive if he is not already there to greet you.

Table Captains will arrive at 5:30pm for training.  Host would like to open up the event space for volunteers at 6pm.  He will then lead them in prayer, give a presentation and then introduce US Hunger staff.  He wishes to MC the event.  There will be no need for a USH intro other then the one he provides.  

The host expects that the packing will begin around 6:30pm.  There might also be more than 225 volunteers.  He mentioned the possibility of 300.  I mentioned that the kids could color and others could assist with refilling and carrying boxes if needed.  I told him that the Day of USH lead could assist with this.  I suspect that the event will conclude before 7:30pm.

Pick-up for both meals and equipment will not be until Wednesday, 9/6.  Host is aware that USH will palletize all equipment and meals and leave them in the worship hall for pick-up on Wednesday.  
Since there will be 3 destinations for the meals, 3 pallets should be used.  There should be ~35 boxes on each pallet.  All will be picked up by Convoy of Hope but they will go to 1) Guatemala 2) Haiti 3) Burkina Faso.  Perhaps sticking in a label or two inside the wrap would be nice.

In addition to 16 Table Captains, the host will provide 2-3 KVs to assist with AL break down.

------------------------------------------
Sound system - Host to provide sound system, playlists and microphone.  Host will also MC.

Floor - Wood. No pallet restrictions.

Parking - Plenty of free parking on site.  Host suggests front parking lot.

Trash - Host aware to provide extra bins

Electric -  There are plenty of standard outlets in the fellowship hall.

The host is very excited to have an introduction by the event lead.  They are interested in our slide presentation and would love it if we mentioned all the events we have planned around 911 and the Atlanta Hawks.  They would also like us to give a quick mention about Philabundance which will be charity where the meals will be distributed.

Prior to event day, the host will assign 4 teams and those teams will pick their table captains (KVs).  The KVs will arrive at 10am for table captain training.  The host has also requested 4 different color hair nets for each team.  We have secured 4 different colors, red, green, orange and yellow which will be packed in the pink bin.  US Hunger will wear white.

Expect a competition from the 4 teams.  They would probably enjoy some box races.  Given this, I suspect that they will finish packing all their meals on time, however, if that is not the case, they are more than happy to stay until they reach their meal goal.

This is a 100% 12 meal pack event!!!!!

----------------------------
Flooring cafeteria - no pallet restrictions, however, pallets might not be able to fit through the cafeteria doors.  Host does have a pallet jack to transport pallets from dock to cafeteria entrance.  Host also has extra carts if needed.

Host will handle load-in and load-out.  Kari Smitherman, 215-280-6377, is your primary contact for load-in and load-out.

Set-up: They have requested set-up on Wednesday, 9/6 from 3pm-5pm.  Primarily because they are not sure where to store the pallets if they can't fit through the cafeteria doors.  

Electricity - Plenty available.  

Trash - Host is aware to have extra trash bins for set-up on 9/6 and HP on 9/7.

Cafeteria has a sound system accessible via blue tooth or cable hookup for computer.  They have wifi.  Bring playlists.

Bring slide show for 5 minute introduction on US Hunger impact.  This can be tested Wednesday evening.

Aramark will clean during and between shifts (floors and trash).","Set up on Sunday as soon as truck arrives. They may have a set up KV crew as well from 1 - 3 pm.

There are branded meal bags and stickers. Best by date printed on 6 meal bags. (If you have to switch to 12 meal bags, you'll need to use the best by stickers printed by USH.)

We have 2 sets of table numbers. 1 set has the number and break down instructions on the bag - attach those to the tables as usual. 2nd set has the number on one side and clean up instructions between shifts on the other. That will be the one held up by the TCs.

-----------

USH arrive onsite at 7 am on event day!

Key Volunteers were recruited by the Eagles staff - 2 shifts:

7:30 am - 2:30 pm 
1:30 pm - 6:30 pm

Expect at least 40 Table Captains and 25 Logistics support. I asked for 1 table captain per line, but they were insistent that their table captains were bored last year, so they wanted to be sure there is enough work for them.

Expect vols to begin arriving 30 min prior to each shift. They'll be assigned an assembly line at check in - run by the Eagles staff.

There's an opening ceremony at the beginning of each shift which will include VIPs and someone singing America the Beautiful. They may or may not want USH to be involved. Be flexible.

Expect about 90 min of meal packing per shift. 12 meal bags are for back up only!! (25% of meal goal was sent in 12 meal bags.)

---------

Shift 1 - Eagles recruited sponsors/volunteers. Expect 500 vols.

Shift 2 - Eagles recruited sponsors/volunteers. Expect 500 vols.

Shift 3 - 9/11 Day recruited sponsors/volunteers. Expect up to 650 vols.

If all lines are full, you'll only need 90 minutes of meal packing per shift. 9/11 Day asked for the volunteers to be placed on lines in groups of 12. However, if not enough people show up, I'd say go down to 10 per line to try to fill up lines.

2 hour shifts, but we really only need 1.5 of meal packing per shift.

--------

flooring - concrete

electrical - in the four corners (VOMs)

sound - house sound; they may have DJ; they'll have AV tech onsite

trash - asked for LOTS of trash cans

parking - free. Park in gravel lot near loading dock. If this is full, park in lot 22F. (Don't park anywhere else as you could receive a parking ticket from the school.)

VIP - suite 2. The venue will set up tables and chairs.

KV and staff meals/break area - Green & Gold Club. The venue will set up tables and chairs for us.

registration - to be handled by Jennifer Bisbee and her team. Give them the hairnets. The venue will provide the tables and chairs.

tables - rentals for the assembly lines. Will be delivered on Friday, 9/8. 

chairs - the venue has chairs in case volunteers can't stand the whole time.

","Set up

There are branded meal bags and stickers. Best by date printed on 6 meal bags. (If you have to switch to 12 meal bags, you'll need to use the best by stickers printed by USH.)

small cut out table numbers should be given to registration so people can find their table number.

We have 2 sets of table numbers. 1 set has the number and break down instructions on the bag - attach those to the tables as usual. 2nd set has the number on one side and clean up instructions between shifts on the other. That will be the one held up by the TCs.

Zones:
1 - 12 = red
13 - 24 = white
25 - 36 = blue

-------------

Event day - arrive back on site no later than 7 am to meet ""Team Leaders"" and prepare for KVs.

KV shift 1 = 7:30 - 11:30 am
KV shift 2 = 11 am - 3 pm

There should be 36 TCs and 24 Logistics. 

There will be 1 TEAM LEAD for the Table Captains and 1 for the Logistics (Heavy Lifters and Runners). Feel free to empower them to do all the communicating with the KVs.

Additional KVs for directional help, registration, and hospitality.

---------

Expect vols to begin arriving 30 min prior to each shift.

Plan for 10 vols per line - that's how 9/11 Day ""sold"" the volunteer spots. Of course, who knows will show up.

There's an opening ceremony at the beginning of each shift which will include VIPs and someone singing America the Beautiful. They may or may not want USH to be involved. Be flexible.

Expect about 90 min of meal packing per shift. 12 meal bags are for back up only!! (25% of meal goal was sent in 12 meal bags.)

The project is being held at a fire station downtown. 

They have invited media and the Mayor to join at 9:30am.

The shift is from 9-11, but they know it won't take the entire time to pack meals. They are planning on the first 30 minutes to be for people to arrive, the 9/11 day talks and some guest speakers. You should start training/packing around 9:30am. They know it probably won't take you until 11am, but they wanted to have buffer time and for the shift to be from 9-11am.

There MAY be some firefighters there to help with load in/out but they will for sure have 4 to serve as table captains. 

You will be packing in the fire engine bay area. They will be pulling the trucks out and there should be plenty of space. When you are looking at the front of the building, we will be setting up on the right side closest to the firefighter's dorm side. Their plan is to leave one engine in the furthest bay area for pictures. You will set up right next to that.

Electric - There are outlets/cords hanging from the ceiling.  I would suggest starting a line right were one of those hang down. 

Sound - USH system. Download your playlist

Parking - You can unload right in front of the bay doors. Please pull the van around to the back parking lot for the event. There is also street parking if needed.

Last year they kind of did a ""come and go"" shift and they never had full lines and had to pack for an extra 20 mins. I talked the host into doing 2 shifts this year so the volunteers didn't feel like they had to stay the whole time and could go out and enjoy the other festivities. You should not need the full 1 each shift as long as all of the lines are full. If you are over packed for shift 1 and feel you need to stop it early, the host is ok with them packing for 45 mins!

They are handling load in/out and MD for us! Amazing!!!

You will do set up the day prior since you will come straight from the other site on project day.

For set up, there is a meeting in the room right before set up so you may have to wait a few minutes to start.

You should have plenty of time to clean up New Hyde Park, grab lunch and drive to this site. Please make sure to allow extra time for NY traffic!

For clean up, you will have to use the carts to get our supplies to the lobby for palletizing. Ask the host the specific place they would like you to store the pallet overnight. 

Also, ask the host where they want you to store the meal boxes. They haven't decided yet. They are handling MD!

The host said the entire path is pallet friendly, but the PEAR says pallets can get most of the way and we have to de-palletize so be ready to have to hand load carts for clean up to get to the area you can palletize. The loading dock isn't too far from the event space.

Since they are handling MD, ask them if they want you to wrap the pallet before you waste time doing it. 

You will be heading straight to the next site after clean up. It's about a 50 min drive, but you should still have time to grab lunch and get to the site on time.

It is an employee appreciation day for people to come hang out. They had a lot of activities after the project last year, bounce house, cash grab, prizes, huge lunch, etc. A lot more people showed up than they expected, but many of them were children.

They want it to be outdoors. They will be providing a tent and I gave her the square footage to ensure all the tables are under it. Flint is not warm this time of year, so that isn't a concern. However it might be a bit cold, so plan for that. If it rains, they will move it into the warehouse. This is what ended up happening last year.

They are handling load in and said they will take charge of moving the pallets outside for you on event day. They are also handling MD!

They did have people talk about how low the tables are when standing, so they are considering putting the second table of the line on risers or having chairs available. I highly encouraged chairs! They also said they may only do that for one or two lines just for the people who need it.

They are a VERY competitive group and loved the box races!

Something we found out last year is that the assembly line tables are the same tables they will need to eat lunch on and lunch is planned for right after the pack. So we basically got everything off the tables as soon as possible and then finished cleaning up. It wasn't ideal, but worked out fine. They had a few people who offered to help.

This group packed with us last year and they are VERY excited to be able to do it again!

They are doing this as part of their Family Fun Day again this year! Shonna made it very clear that our team is invited to join in the lunch and activities!

You will need to clear some tables quickly so they can eat lunch on them. Won't need all of them, but try to clear a handful as soon as you can.

The site is HUGE! She said it is 1 square mile and has 3 entrances. Use the truck entrance. She also said the address should bring you to the correct building and they will have signs to direct you. She also said to just call her when you get there and she can help you.

Will be in a warehouse space. She said there is a lot going on in there, but they are clearing space for the project. 

They are providing at least 10 KVs, but she thinks she will have more!

You probably won't need the full 2 hours to pack but they wanted the buffer time. You can end early if you done packing. 

Please make sure they are clear on which pallets will go to the food banks vs which pallets are coming back to us. Please make sure to label with shipping labels and provide the BOL!

Please make sure that they store all pallets with food in an air-conditioned room. I have talked with the client about this!

The church has participated in many HPs in the past.  The HP is scheduled immediately after mass that typically ends around 11am.  It is tricky because some years the volunteers rush into the room and get started, other years, like last year, they take their time.  In addition, they also take a break during the meal packing for a snack and to taste the RLJ (see below).  Given this, I scheduled the HP to begin at 11:15am and end at 12:45pm to provide a 30 minute cushion.  They are in no hurry! 

Host has requested that USH speak to their children about USH and the impact that this day will have our their community during the children's liturgy.  Approximately 15 minutes into the main service, ~10:15am, , the children are sent to a seperate room for a children's liturgy.  It is during this time where they would like USH to speak to them.

The host has requested 3-4 bags of RLJ to prepare samples for the volunteers.  Please pack these bags during the table captain training @ 11am so that they have plenty of time to prepare.  

Flooring: Hardwood - No pallets can be placed on the floor! They are very protective of their floor. Gaff tape is the only tape that can be used on the floor.

Since all equipment and food need to be unloaded from the van and carried up 4 stairs and through a small door before placing on carts, I have added an extra 30 minutes to set-up.

She is very nice, but timid.

Last year we were told that the building is not pallet friendly, but when our team arrived, they found out it is. I have been told 2 different things from multiple people about load in. Some say that our team will have to move everything and the porters will help only in the conference center and others say the porters have to move everything the entire time. The PEAR from last year says that the porters laid ram board and moved everything to the event space. Please be prepared to do whatever they say. The path to the room is supposed to be pallet friendly even if you have to move it. That is based off of conversations and previous PEARS.

Sound - They have a sound system and wireless mic. You will have to get with their team to set it all up. They can also do the slideshow. They have pre-approved music, but please download a playlist just in case they let you use ours. Their list is short and the employees ""know all of the songs"" so the host would love our music if we are allowed to. :)

Electricity - Outlets in the floor.

Parking - There is onsite parking and the host is working on getting it validated for you.

Flooring - Carpet, Pallets can be placed on the floor.

You will need about 50 minutes of packing time to hit meal goal. 

The original number of volunteers was 60 per shift, but the host opened it up to 80 per shift because of interest and to help if people didn't show up. I told her that is great and we can comfortably accommodate 75 on lines per shift. I told her if you happen to have all 80 show up we will use people to help fill food, carry boxes or set up another sealing station if needed. ","9/26/23

Volunteers will be coming from a general session that ends at 4:00pm so some people might start arriving a bit early. 

The pack is 1.5 hours, but you will only need about an hour of actually packing. Host wanted the buffer time to get people on the lines and to train. 

You will have to table train 2 lines each.

Load in and the event are on the same day due to hotel logistics, the evening schedule and the short distance to our WH. We have given some buffer time for the truck to arrive late.

The room is being used for the conference lunch until 1pm and then the hotel staff will have it flipped by 2pm for our team to set up. You will need to store the pallets back of house until 2pm.

Parking - Park in Self-Parking and take a ticket. Tara with the hotel will provide a validation. I said you would be carpooling, so please only drive 2-3 cars. 

Flooring - Carpet - The hotel is putting polytac down under the pallets and the lines.

Trash - The hotel is providing trash cans but made sure to mention that the host would get an additional cleaning charge if we left a lot of trash around. I told her we were very clean and would pick up after ourselves. Please take extra care to pick up and ""organize'' the trash as much as possible. I happen to know the host is already over budget, so since we have a team of 5, I think it would be great if we could go the extra mile with the trash for this project! Thank you!

We have partnered with the school many times now. They have this annual day of service for the entire school and this year our project is for their 3rd graders.  

There will also be several parent volunteers who are not included in the volunteer count above. They are not including them because they don't want the parents doing the work. The kids should be doing the packing. The parents are only there to help support and supervise the kids. The parents can help make sure the kids are packing properly and be by the sealer and boxing area to help with troubleshooting and box counting. 

They expect 66 3rd graders.  This will put 16-17 students at each line.  They are aware that is a large number.  I mentioned to the host that the EL might ask for volunteers to assist with other activities as appropriate to reduce the AL numbers. 

They want an extended talk track (30 mins). In years past we have shown two videos which helped fill the time. They will have sound and AV set up. Please have the videos pulled up on your computer.

They also have a time prior to the meal packing where the kids decorate the boxes.  

The schedule below is the planned schedule. Over the years they have occasionally deviated from the schedule. Please be flexible!  They have plenty of time baked in to meet their meal goal.

They also cook the RLJ for the kids to eat for lunch that day. They have requested to pick up 25 bags of RLJ from 
our Warehouse prior to the event date so they can slow cook them in crockpots.  I will arrange this with Daniel. 
At the project, pull the first 25 bags from the assembly line to be brought back to the warehouse to replenish what was taken.

We are not allowed to put the wooden pallets or any gaff tape on the gym floor. They will be running the cords from the electrical outlets to a central table for us and placing floor mats over the cord.  Once we run our cords from table to table, they will place rugs over those cords as well.

The host, Jackie, is very nice but overwhelmed currently.  She hasn't opened any documents confirming times etc... so don't be surprised with some last minute changes.  I suggest the EL call her prior to the HP to engage.  The good news is the their logistics lead, Jamille Dixon, 206-496-2398, has been very responsive so I suggest contacting her if needed.

Hines, the dock operators, have agreed to reserve a designated location in the loading dock for your unload on Tuesday, Oct. 3rd and loading on Thurs. Oct. 5th. This is where all pallets will be stored before and after the HP. 
Our scheduled times for delivery and pickup have been approved. Please just check in with security upon arrival.

Unfortunately, this will be a long load-in and load-out because there is no easy way to get pallets from the dock to the event room.  Good news is that a small elevator is close to the dock and the event room.  Due to this, I have scheduled an initial set-up for Tuesday afternoon so that you can at least get the equipment and food up to the event room that day.

Details:
The loading dock elevators do not go to the 4th floor, so materials will have to be unloaded from pallets and transferred through the podium elevators, just on the other side of the loading dock entry. No Pallets will be able to fit in the podium elevator.
The distance between the podium entry on 4 to the multipurpose room is 25 ft. Immediate left from the elevators, a right turn into the PM entrance, then directly in the back.

Katherine Franco, Neighborhood Fridge, 407-232-4811, is your primary day of contact for Key Volunteers.  Meal Distribution and she will also be the MC.

This will be a very unique event as the meeting planner has invited two non-profits, USH and Clean the World, to participate at the same time in the same room.  Clean the World packages hygiene products  Their set-up and packing window is very similar to our.  They will have 10 ALs and approximately the same amount of volunteers for their event.  They will start at the same time as we do and end at approximately the same time as well.  All of this will be handled by a central MC controlling all of this.  I have given the MC talking points for them to incorporate into their introduction about USH.  It will be up to the EL and the MC on how to handle meal count updates and how best to introduce any box races if needed.

The only noticeable difference between the two events is that the MC will provide instruction on how to pack the hygiene boxes from stage at the beginning of the hour.  It will be during this time where our KVs and USH staff should train our ALs like we always do.  

KVs - All Table Captains will be provided by Neighboring Fridge.  They should be able to assist with set-up, table training and potentially clean-up.  Neighboring Fridge will be taking away the meals at the end of the HP. 

Event Room (Pacifica 7) - This ballroom has been newly carpeted.  The hotel will be laying plastic in the areas where the pallets will be put down.  Their breakfast ends at 8am.  Breakdown and room set up will begin then.  The hotel estimates 2 hours to complete the turnover.

Parking - The Creative Group will be providing free parking passes for USH.

Electrical - There are no outlets in the event room.  The hotel will provide access to what we need.

Sound system - Creative Group and MC to provide all equipment and play lists.

Trash - Creative Group has asked for large trash buckets to be placed at each AL

This group has packed in the past and are very excited to get to do it again!

They have asked for load in to be in the morning this time because the truck has historically been late. I told her that we would not be able to be there for load in then. She said that is fine, she has always gotten people to move the supplies from the pallets to the room anyways. Our team just needs to go there to check all of the supplies to make sure everything arrived and is being stored properly. 

You will need 2 lines using 6 meal bags and 1 line using 12 meal bags per shift to hit goal! Don't worry if you go over because this is part of the JPMC Grant and we have had some sites under pack so we have some wiggle room to over pack a little.

For MD and Load out, you will have to use carts to get everything to the loading dock. They have extra carts available to use and are hoping to get some people to stay and help, but it's not guaranteed.

Make sure to bring snacks. This location does not have a cafe to purchase food.

There will be ~ 100 yds from load-in to the event space, Fellowship Hall.  The first 75 yrs or so is a pallet friendly concrete walkway and courtyard.  After that, the supplies will need to be transferred onto carts for an ~ 25 yard trip up a 43 inch wide concrete ramp into the Hall.

USH staff will also need to move all equipment and remaining meals back to a room close to the pick-up area for Monday afternoon pick-up.

Floor - Industrial grade flooring with no restrictions.

Parking - Plenty on-site

There will be several managers attending the conference and this HP will be occurring around their many scheduled meetings at the hotel.  

In order to reduce costs, they have negotiated 2 USH staff members for a 10 AL HP.  With that, they have committed 10 KVs to serve as table captains and 2-3 volunteers to assist with set-up and clean-up.  Specifically to help move the pallets from the loading dock to the event space which is ~ 50-75 feet over some tile and mainly carpet.

Load-in and load-out will be handled by the hotel, however, the host has requested that US Hunger do our initial set-up on Friday evening, 5-7pm, after their days meetings, so that they can provide key volunteers to assist with the set-up. 

Pallets will be kept near the loading dock after load-in.  The HP is on the same level as the dock.  It is ~50-75 feet from the dock to the event room through double doors.  The path from the dock to the conference room is pallet friendly, however, most of the path is carpet.  The hotel or the host will lay plastic across the entire event room floor before set-up on Friday afternoon.  They do not want any spilled food on the carpet even though it is dried.

Following the HP, USH will need to palletize our equipment and bring the pallets back to the loading dock where it will be stored until Monday afternoon pick-up.

PREMIERS KV commitment according to host:
Premier - Secure 2-3 ppl to help (heavy lifting) move items from holding room to event room on Friday
Premier - Secure 2-3 ppl to help (heavy lifting) move items from event space to holding room on Saturday
Premier - 2-3 volunteers to help with general set-up and clean-up
Premier - Provide plastic to the hotel
Premier - Provide gaff tape to the hotel
Premier - Secure people to lay plastic in event space/need completed by 4pm pm on Friday
Premier - 10 key volunteers to train the other volunteers “table captains”
Premier - plan for table training on Saturday morning at 10a

Sound system:  US Hunger to bring sound system and playlists.

Parking: Free at hotel.

Electricity - The floor outlets will be covered by the plastic and can't be used, however, there are wall outlets.  According to the hotel, the gaff tape can be used to secure the cords over the plastic.

Host attended a USH event previously.  They want to make this a social event where meal packing is an option over the 2 hour period.  They plan to have a band, food and potentially pumpkin carving associated during the event.  They are aware that the food/drink can't be close to the ALs.  

They do not expect all volunteers to be there at 4pm.  They also don't expect their volunteers to pack for the entire two hours.   You may decide to start with 3-4 ALs and expand to 5 as the afternoon progresses.  This HP was originally planned for 4 ALs, however, given the uncertainty of the number of meal packers at any given time, I increased it to 5 ALs and requested 12 meal bags just in case there isn't much interest.

Their facilities are very concerned about the weight of the food pallets on their floors so the host will be depalletizing our food and maybe our equipment upon arrival and moving everything ~ 100 ft to close to the event room.  Very generous!  They will also be laying cardboard where they are most concerned.  At the end of the event, be prepared to cart supplies and boxes back to the loading dock area, however, they may not be as concerned about putting several things on a pallet since most of the heavy food bags will have been used.  Once at the loading dock, there will be room to palletize and store our equipment.  The meals might be left in the corridor for the pantry to hand load.  We will need to be flexible on this one.  The good news is that it is all one level.  I added 30 minutes to load-in and clean-up in the event there is more carting than pallet jacking!.

They are also REALLY bummed we couldn't increase their meal goal.

Back up contact - Demetrice Stewart - 318-355-4514 

You will absolutely not need the entire hour for packing each shift! They ended up packing 36K last year and the host would like to beat that if possible. The grant allocation wouldn't allow for me to increase their meals BUT we have underpacked at some other JPMC projects so if you have the time, volunteers and food, you could let them beat last year's number and go to 37,000. ;)

Previous notes say the volunteers at this location were really great and fun to work with. They are a very high energy group. 

The space is pallet friendly all the way up until the actual conference room. Everything is on the first floor. They said they should have a few people help get things in the room and set up. 

One thing that will be cool about this project is that the Food bank is in the same plaza as Chase is. Last year, they popped over to see the project and said a few words. Nothing has been requested or confirmed, but please accommodate this again if they show up. 

There is a really long lunch break. She wanted it to be longer, but I convinced her to shorten it by 30 mins! You should have plenty of time to get something to eat.

Notes from previous PEARS: 
A lot of the shifts had significantly more volunteers than anticipated. We had full lines, food fillers, box shuttlers, an entire sealing table and taught them how to shuttle bags themselves. JPMC was insitatant on having all of the volunteers participate. Volunteer count was high because people signed up for only one shift but then stuck around all day. We had first timers placed on lines first to ensure they had an active role in the event and then filled in from there. 

HIGH ENERGY! Their team really enjoyed emceeing throughout the event. It reminded me of the Atlanta Hawks where it was nonstop talking, so the volunteers weren't really receiving the message but the host was thrilled regardless. They were singing along into the mic and everyone was dancing. Overall, it was phenomenal!

Truck Height Restrictions – No 53ft semi. It would not be able to pull directly into dock height as you don’t have clearance to turn corner. Anything smaller should be fine (i.e. box truck)

Are all doorways and pathways to from the loading dock to the event space pallet friendly and wide enough for pallet to come through? loading dock yes, loading door path way yes. Freight elevator. Yes. But we are not pallet friendly to access bayview ballroom. Required to de-palletize items and place on rolling cart.

Will we use a freight elevator to reach the event space? If so, is the elevator pallet friendly, what is the weight limit. Working on weight limit. Yes pallet friendly but see above notes (“Depalletize”).

Approximately how far from loading dock to events – 5 à 12 minutes depending on how fast we are.

Many volunteers will have extensive experience packing.  Last year we had a few key volunteers help with set-up and clean-up in addition to Table Captains.  I expect the same again this year.

Unlike the past, they have finally agreed to a 15 minute break between shifts.  Previously they did not add a break. This should greatly help in achieving meal goal as the transition and training times would only allow for ~45 minutes of packing each shift.  Although experienced, this group tends to pack slow as it is a networking club and they typically have less volunteers than expected.

US Hunger will need to be present for load-in on Friday between 10:00am-1:00pm.  At that time, we are only required to move the pallets up the concrete ramp to the event room, which is the front foyer.  The path is unobstructed but on a slight incline.  It is ~ 40 yards from a street level delivery through the double doors. 

Host will handle load-out and MD on Monday between 10:00am-1:00pm.  The host likes us to keep the pallets in the foyer so that the parish members see them when going to service the next day.

Foyer floor has no pallet jack or pallet restrictions.

Parking is free in church parking lot.

There is plenty of electricity.

The event rooms, Banda Sea 1&2, are the first rooms to the left from the loading docks so load-in/load-out should be very easy.

The Lowes has just replaced their carpets so they will place plastic on the carpet from the dock to the event room and in the room where the pallets/equipment should be placed.  

USH will need to be present for load-in on Tuesday AM so they can transport the supplies to the event room.  The room will be set-up by then.  

The host will handle load-out and MD on Wednesday PM.

Electricity: Plenty of outlets in the rooms.

Trash:  Lowes will provide extra cans.

Parking:  Michael will have 2 parking passes for USH staff members.  See him during the event.

You will be in a conference room. It has shorter 4 ft tables. I told her will will need 3 tables per line then. I have not heard about the width despite asking several times. 

Load in per building: Pallets need to be broken down at the loading dock, with the contents put in c-bins or the like on dollies for transport to the event space.  Given that the floors on the office floors are terrazzo the use of pallet jacks up on the floors is not permitted.

You will have to use a freight elevator to get to the room on the 3rd floor. Once the freight elevator reaches the 3rd floor, the distance from the freight elevator to the 3rd floor Chesapeake conference room is ~106’.

For MD and load out, you will have to bring everything down on carts to the loading dock to palletize.

Last one in 2019.  This host was involved with several of them.

Past notes say that they are not very enthusiastic but seem to enjoy themselves as they keep coming back and appear to hit meal goal.  

Due to construction, we needed a dedicated delivery for 8am on 11/14.  That is the reason for the early start time for USH staff.  The host is aware that trucks are unreliable and any delays in delivery can jeopardize an on-time start.

Previous PEARs state that load-in/load-out through the dock is the best.  It is a bit longer as it is through two buildings, some turns and a few doors, however, it is all pallet/pallet jack friendly.  Very little carpet.  Host also mentioned that sometimes the trucks don't line up well with the dock so it might be a ground delivery.  There is a ramp on the dock.

There should be plenty of electric outlets and garbage cans.

Parking is free, however, each USH staff needs to provide their full name as it appears on their licence prior to the event.  

Just prior to arrival, please call the host for parking instructions.  You will be entering the building through the dock security entrance.  ","Tuesday, 11/14/23

If each shift has 7 lines going, we'll need 45 min per shift to reach shift goal. Keep energy high, and keep pushing the volunteers so you have a couple minutes between shifts.

It can get pretty competitive between sites - communicate with other ELs at other sites and see where everyone is at on total meals packaged.

Set up kid zone with boxes and markers.

Their loading dock has many truck size issues so we are having the pallets shipped to a terminal the day before and their team will pick it up from the terminal and get it to JPMC and will have everything placed in the cafeteria for you. Charlie is the head of facilities and is FANTASTIC! He remembers us and loves our mission and has been more than willing to help with everything!

This is the first event for our hosts, but they seem to be on top of things!

You will be packing in the cafeteria area which closes at 2:00pm. That is when you can start setting up. You will have to go through security and the host said it could take a little bit so please arrive early to make sure you have enough time. 

If you need to move any pallets during the event, please contact Charlie or the person he places in charge that day. They will have everything ready for you. 

The electrician will be laying electric for the tables and sound for you. Past pears have said this can be a lengthy process so make sure to speak to the electrician as soon as you arrive to make sure it's set up on time.

When the event is over, you will wrap everything in the cafeteria and the facilities team will handle getting it to the loading dock. They know there will be pallets going back to the terminal and pallets going to the food back. Please make sure they know exactly which ones go where. (I know it should be obvious, but our supplies have ended up at food banks before.)
